# distant-signal Helm chart

Deploys the whole National Rail status stack into a single namespace: a
bundled single-replica **PostgreSQL** StatefulSet, a bundled single-replica
**Redis** (persistent by default — see "Using an external Redis" below),
the **api**, the **aggregator**, the **enricher**, the **notifier**, the
**frontend**, the three movement-stream consumers (**trust-consumer**,
**full-coverage-consumer**, **trust-backlog-consumer**) and
**movement-relay** (`movementRelay`), the one Kafka client for RDM's Train
Movements feed, which fills the `movement-events` Redis stream the three
consumers read. It also has these optional, off-by-default workloads:

- five **pollers** under `pollers.*` — four Rail Data Marketplace pollers
  (incidents, stations, tocs, ldbws) plus a TfL Unified API poller (tfl);
- three island-of-Ireland pollers (`pollerIrishRailGtfs`,
  `pollerIrishRailLive`, `pollerNirStations`);
- the **schedulefeed** pod (`scheduleFeed`): an SFTP server for the pushed
  CIF timetable delivery, with `schedule-ingest` and `schedule-reference`
  containers alongside it.

The chart has no subchart
dependencies and no `dependencies:` block, so `helm dependency update` is
never needed and it installs in an air-gapped cluster given the images. It
mirrors the topology, environment contract and cadences that the
repository's `docker-compose.yml` and `local.env.example`/`dev.env.example`
already establish, so the two deployment paths do not drift.

This chart does **not** deploy the derived MCP service ("distant-signal-mcp",
a fork of train-mcp) — see the `railMcp` section under "Values reference"
below for how to point the frontend's in-app chat at a separately-deployed
instance of it.

## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes >= 1.23.** The chart declares `kubeVersion: ">=1.23.0-0"`.
  The NetworkPolicy templates select the ingress-controller namespace via
  the automatic `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label, GA from 1.22.
- **Helm 3.8+ or 4.x.** Developed and verified against Helm v4.1.4.
- **A default StorageClass**, or set `postgresql.persistence.storageClass`
  and `redis.persistence.storageClass` explicitly — the bundled Postgres
  uses a `volumeClaimTemplates` entry and the bundled Redis a standalone
  PVC. Set `postgresql.persistence.enabled: false` or
  `redis.persistence.enabled: false` for throwaway testing (data is lost
  on reschedule), or `postgresql.enabled: false` / `redis.enabled: false`
  to use a managed database/Redis instead.
- **Images already present in a registry the cluster can pull from.** This
  chart builds nothing.

## Building and pushing the images (manual)

`.github/workflows/containers.yml` builds and publishes every image below to
`ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/<service>` automatically (build-only
sanity check on PRs; build + push + cosign-sign on push to main/master) — you
do not need to do this by hand for a normal install, and every `*.image.repository`
below already defaults to that exact path. The table and commands below are
for building and pushing to a registry of your own (e.g. a private registry,
or testing a local change) without going through that pipeline — either set
`global.imageRegistry` (see values.yaml) to swap every image's registry at
once, or point each `*.image.repository` you're replacing at your own
`$REG/...` directly.

The same workflow packages this chart and pushes it to
`oci://ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/charts/distant-signal`, cosign-signed keylessly
like the images (INF-12). Verify a pulled chart with:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/charts/distant-signal@sha256:<digest> \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Distant-Signal/.github/workflows/containers.yml@refs/heads/main
```

In Flux, set `verify.provider: cosign` with a `matchOIDCIdentity` entry for
that issuer and subject on the chart's OCIRepository/HelmRepository.

Redis is **not** in this table: the bundled Redis uses the upstream `redis`
image (`redis.image.*`), which this repository does not build.

Then point each `*.image.repository` value at `$REG/...`. An empty
`image.tag` falls back to the chart's `appVersion`.

**Pinning by content digest instead of tag.** Every first-party service
above also has an `*.image.digest` value (e.g. `api.image.digest`), empty
by default. When set to a real `sha256:<64 hex chars>` digest, it takes
priority over `tag`/`appVersion` entirely: the rendered image reference
becomes `<repository>@<digest>` with no tag at all, since a digest is the
only fully immutable reference (a tag, even an otherwise-immutable-looking
`sha-<short-sha>` one, can in principle be re-pushed to point at different
content; `repo@sha256:...` cannot). `.github/workflows/containers.yml`'s
`push-helm-chart` job populates this automatically for every first-party
image in the packaged chart's own default `values.yaml`, from that same
run's real, already-pushed image digests -- so a plain `helm install`
against a chart pulled from `oci://ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/charts` already
pins every first-party image by digest with no operator action needed. Set
it by hand (`--set api.image.digest=sha256:...`) only if you're building
and pushing your own images per the table above and want the same
guarantee for them. `postgresql`, `redis`, `devAuthentik` and
`scheduleFeed.sftp` (all externally-sourced, not built by this repo) have
no `digest` field. They are digest-pinned through the tag instead: their
default `tag` values carry the digest (e.g. `7.4.11@sha256:...`), which
`distant-signal.image` appends after `:`, giving `<repository>:<tag>@<digest>`.
Override one the same way, with a `<tag>@sha256:...` string.

## Install

```bash
helm install distant-signal ./charts/distant-signal -n distant-signal --create-namespace \
  --set enricher.llm.baseUrl=https://llm.example.com/v1 \
  --set enricher.llm.model=your-model-name \
  --set api.sso.issuerUrl=https://sso.example.com/realms/rail \
  --set api.sso.clientId=distant-signal \
  --set api.sso.clientSecret=your-oidc-client-secret \
  --set api.sso.redirectUrl=https://status.example.com/api/auth/callback \
  --set api.sso.postLoginRedirectUrl=https://status.example.com/ \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.brokers=kafka.example.com:9092 \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.topic=TRAIN_MVT_ALL_TOC \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.consumerGroup=SC-your-rdm-group-id \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.saslMechanism=PLAIN \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.saslUsername=your-rdm-kafka-username \
  --set trustConsumer.kafka.saslPassword=your-rdm-kafka-password
```

An install brings up **postgres + redis + api + aggregator + enricher +
notifier + frontend + trust-consumer + full-coverage-consumer +
trust-backlog-consumer + movement-relay**, with **every poller and the
schedulefeed pod off**. See "Enabling the pollers" below for why the
pollers are off.

`enricher.llm.baseUrl`, `enricher.llm.model`, the five `api.sso.*` values
and the RDM Train Movements Kafka connection above are the chart's
**required** values; everything else has a working default. Leaving any of
them empty **aborts the render** with an explicit message rather than
deploying a pod that cannot work:

- The enricher has no `enabled` toggle, and `baseUrl`/`model` become plain
  (non-optional) env vars on its binary, so an empty value would deploy a
  pod that fails every extraction request forever with nothing but log
  noise to show for it.
- The api's five `SSO_*` env vars are declared with no defaults in
  `crates/api/src/data/config.rs`, so an api container missing any of them
  exits immediately with "the following required arguments were not
  provided" and `CrashLoopBackOff`s. See "Single sign-on (OIDC)" below.
- movement-relay is on by default because the three consumers read only
  the stream it writes. Each `movementRelay.kafka.*` value that is left
  empty falls back to the matching `trustConsumer.kafka.*` value (brokers,
  topic, consumer group, SASL mechanism), and without a credential of its
  own it reads trust-consumer's SASL credential, so the one
  `trustConsumer.kafka.*` block above configures it. The render fails if
  neither block has brokers, topic, consumer group and SASL mechanism. For
  an install that does not ingest TRUST train movements, set
  `movementRelay.enabled=false` instead; the three consumers then run on
  an empty stream. The render also fails if `trustConsumer.movementFeed`
  or `fullCoverageConsumer.movementFeed` is `kafka` and that consumer
  shares movement-relay's consumer group, since two members of one group
  split its partitions.

The enricher is a strictly additive signal: its extractions only adjust
the severity an incident already gives a line (a high-confidence
`apparent_severity` can raise it; a resolved/residual status, a schedule
window that excludes now or an elapsed period can lower it), and never
suppress a status. A missing, failed or
low-confidence extraction is a no-op, so a broken LLM endpoint degrades the
enricher's own output and nothing else — the status pages keep working.

With the worked example values:

```bash
helm install distant-signal ./charts/distant-signal -n distant-signal --create-namespace \
  -f charts/distant-signal/values-example.yaml
```

## Upgrade

```bash
helm upgrade distant-signal ./charts/distant-signal -n distant-signal
```

Read the next section before upgrading if you rely on generated secrets.

> **Upgrade note: Redis PVC default 1Gi -> 4Gi (2026-09-27).** A PVC can only
> grow, and only on a StorageClass with `allowVolumeExpansion: true`; k3s
> `local-path` and other hostPath-style classes cannot expand. **Before
> upgrading an existing install whose Redis PVC was created at 1Gi on such a
> class, pin its current size (`--set redis.persistence.size=1Gi`, or in your
> values/overlay) or set `redis.persistence.existingClaim` to the PVC.**
> Otherwise the upgrade can fail when Kubernetes rejects the PVC change.

> so. That lookup sees nothing under `helm template`, `--dry-run` or Argo CD,
> which is why the pin is still required there. On an expandable class the

> **Upgrade note: movement-relay on by default (2026-09-28).**

> its render fails unless `trustConsumer.kafka.*` (or
> `movementRelay.kafka.*`) holds the Kafka connection; set
> `movementRelay.enabled=false` to keep the old behaviour. If such an

`api` and `aggregator` roll concurrently with no ordering guarantee between
them. When a release adds a database migration that `aggregator` depends on
(as `20260822120000_line_status_source.sql` did, for the `line_status.source`
column `aggregator`'s TfL write path requires), a new `aggregator` pod can
start before `api` has finished running its in-process migrations, and will
log write errors until `api` becomes ready and applies them. This is
self-healing — `aggregator` retries on its normal poll cycle, so no data is
lost — but expect a brief window of `aggregator` error logs during such an
upgrade; it is not a sign of a failed rollout.

## Renaming an existing release

Helm has no in-place chart-rename operation for a release. This chart's own
`templates/_helpers.tpl` derives every object name from `.Release.Name` /
`.Chart.Name`, so a plain `helm upgrade` of an existing release against this
renamed chart directory does **not** rename the existing objects — it
produces a brand-new set of derived names (a StatefulSet with a new name, and
a new, empty `volumeClaimTemplates` PVC alongside the old one) rather than
renaming what is already running.

If you have an existing release installed from this chart's previous
location (before it was renamed to `charts/distant-signal`) and want to move
it onto the new path under a new release name without losing data, this
chart's own `postgresql.persistence.existingClaim` value already supports
the low-risk path below:

```bash
# 1. Capture the current config.
helm get values <old-release> -n <ns> -o yaml > values.yaml

# 2. Note the existing Postgres PVC's actual name.
kubectl get pvc -n <ns>

# 2b. Capture the generated Postgres password BEFORE uninstalling — `helm
#     uninstall` deletes the Secret that holds it, and `helm get values`
#     (step 1) does not capture a render-time-generated value (see
#     "Generated secrets and the `lookup` limitation" below for why it's
#     generated at all).
kubectl get secret -n <ns> <old-release> \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.postgres-password}' | base64 -d; echo

# 3. Remove the old release. StatefulSet-owned PVCs are NOT deleted by
#    `helm uninstall`, so the data survives this step.
helm uninstall <old-release> -n <ns>

# 4. Install under the new chart/release name, binding the new StatefulSet
#    to the pre-existing PVC instead of provisioning an empty one, and
#    pinning the Postgres password to the value captured in step 2b — a
#    fresh `helm install` has no live Secret to `lookup` and would otherwise
#    generate a brand-new random password that can never authenticate
#    against the reused volume's already-`initdb`'d data directory.
helm install <new-release-name> ./charts/distant-signal -n <ns> \
  -f values.yaml \
  --set postgresql.persistence.existingClaim=<the PVC name from step 2> \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=<the value captured in step 2b>
```

**If the old release predates this chart's rename**, one more mismatch
applies: this rename changed `postgresql.auth.username` and
`postgresql.auth.database`'s defaults from `nr_status` to `distant_signal`.
An old release that never set these explicitly gets the *new* defaults on
the fresh install above, but the reused PVC's data directory still has the
*old* role and database (`nr_status`) created inside it — so the rendered
`DATABASE_URL` would point at a role/database that doesn't exist in the
reused volume. Either pin the install to the reused volume's actual,
pre-existing names:

```bash
  --set postgresql.auth.username=nr_status \
  --set postgresql.auth.database=nr_status
```

or, before reinstalling under the new defaults, rename them in place inside
the reused database (e.g. `ALTER ROLE nr_status RENAME TO distant_signal;`
and `ALTER DATABASE nr_status RENAME TO distant_signal;`).

**This path is untested against a real cluster** — no live install of this
chart exists to verify it against as of this writing. Take a backup or
snapshot of the database before attempting it regardless of how confident the
steps above look — this is doubly true given the password- and
default-name-migration steps above.

## Generated secrets and the `lookup` limitation

`postgres-password` is generated with `randAlphaNum 32` when its value is
left empty and no `existingSecret` is given. It is the only chart-generated
secret today — every internal caller's own OAuth2 credential (see
"Internal-service OAuth2" below) is assigned by Authentik, an external
system, so a randomly generated value would just be rejected by it; those
follow the same never-auto-generated posture as each poller's own RDM
`apiKey`.

`postgres-password` is **preserved across `helm upgrade`**:
`templates/secret.yaml` reads the live Secret back out of the cluster with
Helm's `lookup` function and reuses whatever is already there, rather than
generating a fresh password and rotating it out from under the running
database's PVC.

**Limitation:** `lookup` returns nothing during `helm template` and
`--dry-run`, so an offline render shows a **different** generated value
every time you run it. That is cosmetic for dry runs, but it does mean
**`helm template | kubectl apply` is not a supported install path when you
rely on the generated postgres password** — the applied password would
differ from the one already in the cluster. For that workflow, set an
explicit value (`postgresql.auth.password`) or use `existingSecret`.

Read the generated value back out:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n distant-signal distant-signal \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.postgres-password}' | base64 -d; echo
```

## Using externally-managed secrets

Every secret value accepts an `existingSecret` + key override, so a
production install can leave all values empty and point at Secrets managed
by External Secrets Operator, Vault or SOPS. **Any key supplied this way is
omitted from the chart-rendered Secret entirely** — the chart never sees,
stores or renders the value.

```yaml
postgresql:
  auth:
    existingSecret: distant-signal-db
    existingSecretPasswordKey: password

pollers:
  incidents:
    enabled: true
    baseUrl: https://rdm.example.com/incidents
    existingSecret: distant-signal-rdm
    existingSecretApiKeyKey: incidents-api-key
    # A single existingSecret toggle covers both this poller's RDM apiKey
    # AND its own internal-oauth username/password (all three keys must
    # live in the same referenced Secret).
    existingSecretInternalOauthUsernameKey: incidents-oauth-username
    existingSecretInternalOauthPasswordKey: incidents-oauth-password
  ldbws:
    enabled: true
    baseUrl: https://rdm.example.com/LDBWS/api/20220120
    existingSecret: distant-signal-rdm
    existingSecretApiKeyKey: ldbws-api-key

enricher:
  llm:
    baseUrl: https://llm.example.com/v1
    model: your-model-name
    existingSecret: distant-signal-llm
    existingSecretApiKeyKey: llm-api-key

api:
  sso:
    issuerUrl: https://sso.example.com/realms/rail
    clientId: distant-signal
    existingSecret: distant-signal-sso
    existingSecretClientSecretKey: client-secret
    redirectUrl: https://status.example.com/api/auth/callback
    postLoginRedirectUrl: https://status.example.com/
```

The Postgres StatefulSet and its api/aggregator/enricher consumers resolve
the password reference through the *same* template helper, so an
`existingSecret` override can never leave them disagreeing about which
Secret holds the password.

## Single sign-on (OIDC)

The api authenticates users against an external OIDC provider (Keycloak,
Authentik, Authelia, Entra ID, Okta, …) — this chart deploys no identity
provider of its own. Sign-in gates the **per-user** features only (pinning
lines and stations, creating and editing custom lines); the line-status
pages themselves stay readable without signing in.

All five `api.sso.*` values are **required** and the render aborts if any
is missing, because `crates/api` declares its `SSO_*` env vars with no
defaults — an api container without them exits before `main` runs.

Two details that are easy to get wrong:

- **`redirectUrl` is the frontend's origin, not the api's.** Register
  `https://<frontend-host>/api/auth/callback` with your provider and put
  that same string here. The callback issues the session cookie, and a
  cookie set on the api's origin would never be sent back by the browser,
  which talks to the frontend for everything else. The frontend's
  `/api/*` catch-all proxies the request through to the api's
  `/public/auth/callback` and forwards the `Set-Cookie` back unmodified.
- **The session cookie is `Secure`**, so sign-in only works over HTTPS.
  Terminate TLS at the ingress (see "Ingress" below) before expecting
  login to work.

`clientSecret` follows the chart's usual secret rule — supply it inline and
it is rendered into the chart Secret as `sso-client-secret`, or point
`api.sso.existingSecret` at a Secret you manage and the chart never sees
it. Unlike the postgres password it is **never auto-generated**: a random
value would simply be rejected by the issuer — same posture as every
internal-oauth username/password below.

## Local dev identity provider (devAuthentik)

For a local/dev Kubernetes cluster (kind, minikube, k3d) only — set
`devAuthentik.enabled: true` to bring up a throwaway local Authentik
instance and skip registering this app with a real external IdP entirely.
Mirrors `docker-compose.authentik.yml`'s job for the `docker compose`
deployment path. **Off by default; an install pointed at a real external
IdP is completely unaffected.**

When enabled and `api.sso.*` is left at its empty default, the chart
computes it from `devAuthentik.*` and the fixed, blueprint-provisioned
dev-only OIDC client (`client_id: distant-signal-dev`) — no manual IdP-side
setup, matching `docker-compose.authentik.yml`'s own zero-click bootstrap.
An explicit `api.sso.*` value always wins.

```yaml
devAuthentik:
  enabled: true
```

**Two manual steps this chart cannot do for you:**

1. **Forward `devAuthentik.service.nodePort` (default `30900`) to your
   machine's loopback interface**, using whatever mechanism your cluster
   tool provides:
   - kind: an `extraPortMappings` entry in your cluster config, e.g.
     ```yaml
     nodes:
       - role: control-plane
         extraPortMappings:
           - containerPort: 30900
             hostPort: 30900
     ```
   - minikube: `minikube tunnel`
   - k3d: `k3d cluster create --port 30900:30900@loadbalancer`

   This step lives in your cluster-creation config, not in this chart —
   see the design doc's Research for why a Helm chart cannot bind a port
   on the host machine itself.

2. **On your very first `helm install` with `devAuthentik.enabled: true`**
   (unless you also set `devAuthentik.hostAliasIP` explicitly), run `helm
   upgrade` once immediately afterward. `NOTES.txt` reminds you of this
   after every install/upgrade where `devAuthentik.enabled` is `true`.

**Known limitations / unverified, stated plainly rather than assumed
solved:**

- The `hostAliases`-vs-`lookup` first-install ordering gap above has no
  fully graceful degradation — it requires the one-time `helm upgrade`
  workaround, not a design this chart claims to have fully closed.
- The NodePort-forwarding step is entirely outside this chart's control and
  cannot be verified from inside a `helm template`/`helm install` run — if
  you skip it, the chart installs cleanly and the failure only shows up as
  "the browser can't reach Authentik," with no render-time signal.
- None of the above has been smoke-tested by this chart's own authors
  against a real kind/minikube/k3d cluster as of this writing — see
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-dev-oidc-server.md`'s Task 13 for
  what was and wasn't actually verified (that plan was pruned from the tree
  in commit `b7f71a8a`; read it from git history).

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-dev-oidc-server-design.md` for the
full design, including why `AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_*` is deliberately never
set (no default admin — see its Bootstrap section) and why this is a
hand-rolled deployment rather than the official `goauthentik/helm` chart
(see its Non-goals).

## Using an external database

Set `postgresql.enabled: false` and configure `externalDatabase`. Provide
**either** an `existingSecret` holding the whole connection URL (preferred —
it keeps the password out of `helm get values` as well as out of the
Deployment spec):

```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: false
externalDatabase:
  existingSecret: distant-signal-db
  existingSecretUrlKey: database-url
```

**or** a literal URL:

```yaml
postgresql:
  enabled: false
externalDatabase:
  url: postgres://distant_signal:s3cret@db.example.com:5432/distant_signal
```

Setting `postgresql.enabled: false` with neither aborts rendering with an
explicit message rather than deploying an api that cannot connect. When the
bundled Postgres is disabled, no Postgres objects render at all and no
`PGPASSWORD` env var is injected.

## Using an external Redis

Redis backs two independent Redis Streams here, with two very different
durability profiles:

- `incident-text-changed`: the api publishes an event when an incident's
  text changes, and the enricher consumes it to re-extract promptly. Losing
  this one costs nothing but promptness — the enricher's hourly sweep
  re-finds anything a dropped event would have triggered.
- `movement-events`: the **sole transport** between movement-relay (this
  chart's one real Kafka client) and its three downstream consumer groups,
  trust-consumer, full-coverage-consumer and trust-backlog-consumer. There
  is no replay source
  behind it — losing this one loses data outright, not just promptness.

Because of the second stream, the bundled Redis runs with persistence
**on by default**: a PVC (`redis.persistence.*`, disable with
`redis.persistence.enabled: false`) plus `--appendonly yes`. This was not
always the case — see redis-deployment.yaml's own comment for the
2026-09-04 production incident (a Redis restart with no persistence wiped
`movement-events` and both consumer groups) that this default responds to.

### Sizing

Nearly all of this Redis's memory is `movement-events`. Its length is capped
at `movementRelay.streamMaxLen` entries (default 1,048,576, about 24 hours
of traffic at the ~1M entries/day measured in production). That default
comes from a 1 GiB budget at roughly 1 KiB per entry. `redis.maxmemory`
(1536mb) is that budget plus 50%, and the 2560Mi memory limit leaves room
above `maxmemory` for fragmentation and fork copy-on-write:

| | Memory |
|---|---|
| Steady state: 1,048,576 entries at ~920 B each | ~920 MiB |
| `maxmemory` 1536mb x 1.06 fragmentation | ~1628 MiB |
| + 25% copy-on-write during an AOF rewrite | +384 MiB |
| + process baseline and client buffers | +~30 MiB, ~2.0 GiB total |
| Limit | 2560Mi (~520 MiB spare) |

Change the three together. Every extra 100,000 entries needs about 100 MiB
more `maxmemory` and about 130 MiB more limit. At this size the AOF on
disk can reach 1-2 GB, so `redis.persistence.size` defaults to 4Gi (it was
1Gi before 2026-09-27; see the upgrade note under [Upgrade](#upgrade)); a
full volume makes Redis refuse writes.
RDB snapshots are off (`redis.save: ""`) because AOF already persists
everything, and each snapshot forks the process.

Set `redis.enabled: false` and give a URL to point at a managed instance
instead:

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: false
  externalUrl: redis://redis.example.com:6379
```

Setting `redis.enabled: false` **without** `redis.externalUrl` aborts
rendering with an explicit message — previously the chart would silently
point both the api and the enricher at an in-chart Service that was never
created. For a password-protected external Redis, keep `externalUrl`
credential-free and use `redis.auth` with `existingSecret` (next section);
a URL with inline credentials also works but is visible in the rendered
Deployment.

## Redis authentication (optional)

Off by default (`redis.auth.enabled: false`); with it off the chart renders
exactly what it rendered before the option existed. When enabled:

- every Redis client (api, enricher, trust-consumer, trust-backlog-consumer,
  full-coverage-consumer, movement-relay) gets `REDIS_PASSWORD` from a
  Secret via `secretKeyRef`. `REDIS_URL` stays credential-free; the services
  combine the two at startup (`crates/common/src/redis_auth.rs`, which
  percent-encodes the password, so any characters work) and authenticate as
  `AUTH default <password>`. The password is never in values, in the URL or
  in any rendered manifest, and the services never log it;
- with `redis.auth.requirePass: true` (the default) the bundled Redis starts
  with `--requirepass` from the same Secret, and its probes authenticate
  through `REDISCLI_AUTH`.

The password comes from `redis.auth.existingSecret` / `existingSecretKey`
(preferred; required for an external Redis) or, when that is empty, from a
random 32-character `redis-password` the chart generates in its own Secret
and keeps across upgrades (see "Generated secrets and the `lookup`
limitation").

**Enabling it on a running deployment, without an outage.** Redis 7.4 (the
chart's image) accepts `AUTH default <anything>` while the default user has
no password yet, and that is the form the clients send (verified against
`redis:7.4.11`). So give the clients the password first:

1. Create the Secret, then upgrade with `redis.auth.enabled=true`,
   `redis.auth.requirePass=false`, `redis.auth.existingSecret=<name>`. Only
   the six client Deployments roll; the Redis pod is not touched. Confirm
   they are Ready and log no `NOAUTH`/`WRONGPASS`.
2. Upgrade again with `redis.auth.requirePass=true` (the default). Only Redis
   restarts (Recreate, AOF on the PVC: the same short gap as any Redis
   restart), and the clients reconnect with the password.

Doing both in one upgrade works too, but client pods still on the old spec
get `NOAUTH` until they are replaced. A fresh install can enable both at
once.

**Rotation.** Clients read the password at process start and Redis at pod
start; changing the Secret restarts nothing. To rotate without errors:
upgrade with `requirePass=false` (Redis restarts without a password),
update the Secret and `kubectl rollout restart` the six client
Deployments, then upgrade with `requirePass=true`.

## Password encoding caveat

`DATABASE_URL` is a URL. A password containing any of `@ : / ? # [ ] %` must
be **percent-encoded by you** before being put into
`postgresql.auth.password` (or into an `existingSecret`). The chart cannot
do it for you: with `existingSecret` it never sees the value, and with the
bundled path the password is injected as `$(PGPASSWORD)` and expanded by the
kubelet at container start, never by the template engine.

Generated passwords use `randAlphaNum` (letters and digits only), so the
default path is never affected.

The password is deliberately never written into a Deployment spec. It is
injected as its own `secretKeyRef` env entry and referenced from
`DATABASE_URL` with Kubernetes' `$(VAR)` syntax, so `get deployments` — a
strictly wider audience than `get secrets` — never sees it.

## Cold archive (optional)

Off by default. When `archive.enabled` is false, the aggregator renders no
`ARCHIVE_*` env and its retention prunes simply delete. When enabled, the
rows that `trains` retention is about to prune (together with their
`train_movement_events`/`train_current_state` children) are written first to
S3-compatible storage as zstd JSON Lines, and deleted only once the upload
is confirmed (size plus ETag = body MD5). `archive.s3.bucket` and
`archive.s3.existingSecret` are required when enabled. Something must also
expire archived objects, so the chart refuses to render until either
`archive.s3.lifecycleConfirmed: true` (you confirm the bucket has an S3
lifecycle expiration rule) or `archive.expiry.enabled: true` (the
aggregator expires them itself, for stores such as Thoth with no lifecycle
API; dry-run by default, with a hard 90-day retention floor, protected
prefixes and a per-run cap). `trust_event_backlog` and the LDBWS-derived
tables cannot be archived, and movement events are archived without their
TRUST `raw_body` (licensing). See [docs/cold-archive.md](../../docs/cold-archive.md)
for the key layout, the failure policy, and how to read an archive with
DuckDB.

## Movement-stream dead letters

`trust-consumer`, `trust-backlog-consumer` and `full-coverage-consumer` move
records that can never succeed (an explicit `api` data rejection, or a
malformed or unparseable entry) to the Redis stream
`movement-events-deadletter`. They never move an entry there only because
`api` was down or slow; those entries stay pending and are retried. The
stream is never trimmed. Alert on
`distant_signal_movement_feed_deadlettered_total`. See
[docs/movement-events-deadletter.md](../../docs/movement-events-deadletter.md)
for how to inspect records and re-inject them with `redis-cli`.

The same three consumers, and `movement-relay`, serve two health paths.
`/healthz` is readiness: it needs the Kafka or Redis connection (for
`movement-relay`, a confirmed Kafka partition assignment). `/livez` is
liveness and does not depend on Redis, Kafka or Postgres. Both answer 503
`stalled` when no loop iteration has completed for
`<component>.progressStallSecs` (300s, or 900s for `fullCoverageConsumer` and
`movementRelay`). The liveness probes use `/livez`, so they restart a wedged
pod but not one that is waiting for Redis to come back.

## Full-coverage consumer restarts

On start, `full-coverage-consumer` waits for its first schedule population
load, then replays the current rail day from `movement-events` before it
consumes as its group, so a restart no longer corrupts that day's stats. A day
it cannot replay in full (its start already trimmed, or the Kafka backend) is
marked `partial`. The measured startup peak with a production-sized population
and a full day's stream is about 373 MiB, well inside
`fullCoverageConsumer.resources.limits.memory`. See
[docs/full-coverage-consumer.md](../../docs/full-coverage-consumer.md) for the
startup sequence, partial days, and the metrics to alert on
(`distant_signal_full_coverage_consumer_startup_complete`,
`..._day_partial`, `..._stream_gap_detected_total` and more).

## Scheduled jobs and time zones

Every CronJob this chart renders sets `spec.timeZone` explicitly, and CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, helm-lint job, "every CronJob sets timeZone")
fails any render that has a CronJob without one, or with a zone name that
tzdata doesn't know. Without the field, a schedule is read in the node's
local zone, which belongs to the host rather than the cluster. On
mine-bringer the node runs at UTC+2, so a job commented "02:00 UTC" really
ran at 00:00 UTC.

- Backups and maintenance use `Etc/UTC`, so they have no DST jumps.
- Jobs tied to the GB rail day use `Europe/London`, and keep their schedules
  out of 01:00–02:59 local, where DST transitions skip or repeat a run.

Start backup schedules at or after 03:00 UTC (mine-bringer's own backups
occupy 03:00–04:15, so the pgBackRest jobs start at 05:00). The nightly schedule
ingest takes deliveries between 22:00 and 01:30 and runs whole-day
publishes, the heaviest WAL and CPU bursts of the day, and 03:00 UTC is
clear of that window in both GMT and BST. See
[the backup design](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-backup-and-observability-gaps-design.md),
item 2.

## Point-in-time recovery (optional)

Off by default (`postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled: false`), and while off the
Postgres pod renders exactly as without it. When enabled, the bundled
Postgres runs `docker/postgres-pgbackrest.Dockerfile` (the same
`postgres:16.15-trixie` plus pgBackRest, with tini as PID 1), archives its WAL to an S3
repository with client-side AES-256 encryption, and CronJobs take a weekly
full backup, a daily differential, a daily check (`check` and a WAL gap
check) and a weekly `verify`. The CronJobs `kubectl exec` into the Postgres
pod; their Role allows only `get` and `pods/exec` on that one pod.
`archive.queueMax` (archive-push-queue-max) drops WAL rather than let
`pg_wal` fill the disk when the repository is unreachable, and the daily
check reports the gap that leaves.

Required when enabled: `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.tag` (the image's
stable tag with its digest), `repo.path`, `repo.s3.endpoint`,
`repo.s3.bucket` and `repo.s3.existingSecret`, a Secret holding
`access-key-id`, `secret-access-key` and `cipher-pass`. No secret is ever
taken from values. Keep an offline copy of the cipher passphrase: the
repository can't be read without it.

Run `pgbackrest stanza-create` in the Postgres pod as soon as it is ready
after enabling (docs/postgres-pitr.md, "Enabling it", step 7); the chart
doesn't do it for you. Until then every archive-push fails: WAL builds up
in `pg_wal` and the spool and the archive alerts fire, but Postgres keeps
running. Only pin image tags with `-tini`: in older images the postmaster
is PID 1, and a failing async archive-push crash-restarts it every ~10 s.

A stop while S3 is unreachable waits for the archiver's last archive-push
attempts, each up to `archive.pushTimeoutSecs` (30s). With pgBackRest on,
the Postgres pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and `PGCTLTIMEOUT`
therefore default to 6 x that + 60 (240s): a stop then ends cleanly
instead of in a SIGKILL and crash recovery, and a first-start initdb
waits instead of failing. Still, enable pgBackRest on an initialised
database with S3 reachable (docs/postgres-pitr.md, "Enabling it").

It doesn't replace a logical dump. See
[docs/postgres-pitr.md](../../docs/postgres-pitr.md) for enabling it
(including `stanza-create`), the alerts, a point-in-time restore, and the
restore drill.

## Ingress

Off by default (`ingress.enabled: false`). The production deployment does not
use it at all: it runs no ingress controller, and public traffic arrives
through a Cloudflare tunnel (Cloudflare -> cloudflared -> the frontend
Service), with the frontend proxying `/api/*` to the in-cluster api Service.

When enabled, one `Ingress` object with up to two **separate hostnames**, both optional and
independently toggleable:

| Value | Backend | Path |
|---|---|---|
| `ingress.frontend.host` | frontend Service :3000 | `/` |
| `ingress.api.host` | api Service :8080 | `/` |

**Separate hostnames, not path-splitting one host.** The api mounts its
four TfL-compatible line-status endpoints at *unprefixed* top-level paths
(`GET /Line/Mode/national-rail/Status`, `GET /StopPoint/{crs}/Disruption`)
rather than under `/public`, so clients written against TfL's own API work
unchanged (`crates/api/src/routes/mod.rs`). Splitting a single host by path
prefix would either collide with Next.js's own routes or break that
compatibility.

`className`, arbitrary `annotations` and a `tls` list are all pass-through
values; the `tls` block is shaped for cert-manager's `cluster-issuer`
annotation but is issuer-agnostic.

> longer exposes it at all.

Enabling either host without setting its hostname aborts the render.

## NetworkPolicy

Off by default (`networkPolicy.enabled: false`). Many clusters run a CNI
that does not enforce NetworkPolicy at all, and a silently-unenforced policy
is worse than an absent one because it looks like protection.

When enabled, the chart renders default-deny ingress per workload plus these
explicit allows:

- **postgres** ← api, aggregator, enricher and notifier only (the pollers
  and consumers never talk to it; they reach the database only indirectly,
  via the api's ingest endpoints).
- **redis** ← api, enricher, trust-consumer, trust-backlog-consumer,
  full-coverage-consumer and movement-relay. Rendered only when
  `redis.enabled`.
- **api** ← frontend, every enabled poller, the consumers, schedulefeed, and — when `ingress.enabled` and
  `ingress.api.enabled` — the namespace named by
  `networkPolicy.ingressControllerNamespace`, plus every namespace in
  `networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressNamespaces`, all on `api.service.port`.
  An extra namespace with an entry in
  `networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressPodLabels` admits only the pods matching
  those labels. The default entry narrows `ds-mcp` to the
  Distant-Signal-MCP's `mcp` pod, so its Redis cannot reach the api.
- **frontend** ← that same ingress-controller namespace, when
  `ingress.enabled` and `ingress.frontend.enabled`, and the tunnel
  connector pods, when `networkPolicy.tunnel.enabled`.
- **api**: `metrics.port` from the namespace named by
  `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace` when `metrics.enabled`. This is
  separate from, and does not widen, the `api.service.port` allow above: api
  serves `/metrics` on its own internal-only listener.
- **Background workers** (aggregator, enricher, notifier, trust-consumer,
  trust-backlog-consumer, full-coverage-consumer, movement-relay, every
  poller including the three island-of-Ireland ones; INF-10): their own
  metrics port from the monitoring namespace (when `metrics.enabled`), and
  their health port(s) from any source, because kubelet probes come from the
  node, which no selector can name. Nothing else.
- **schedulefeed** (INF-2): SFTP on `scheduleFeed.sftp.port` from any source,
  or only from `scheduleFeed.sftp.allowedCidrs` when set. The allow-list only
  works when the pod sees the client's real address (Service
  `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`, or a load balancer that preserves it);
  behind source NAT it blocks every push. Also both containers' health ports
  and metrics ports.

**Tunnels (cloudflared).** With no Ingress, a tunnel connector running in
the cluster publishes the site. `networkPolicy.tunnel.enabled: true` (off by
default) admits the pods matching `networkPolicy.tunnel.podLabels` in
`networkPolicy.tunnel.namespace` (default `cloudflared`,
`app.kubernetes.io/name: cloudflared`) to the frontend only. The api keys its
rate limits on the `X-Real-IP` header (`api.rateLimit.trustXRealIp`), which
the frontend's proxy overwrites from `CF-Connecting-IP`. A request sent
straight from the tunnel to the api keeps whatever `X-Real-IP` its client
sent, so the client could choose its own rate-limit key. Route public
hostnames to the frontend. If a hostname really must go straight to the api,
set `networkPolicy.tunnel.api: true`. The render then fails unless
`api.rateLimit.trustXRealIp` is false. With that off, every request the
frontend proxies shares the frontend pod's one bucket, so the per-client
limits become one site-wide limit.

NetworkPolicies are additive. A cluster-level policy that already lets the
tunnel reach the api on `api.service.port` still does after this.
Narrowing the chart's policies cannot remove it.

**Egress is unrestricted by default.** `networkPolicy.egress.enabled: true`
(off by default) adds an egress policy to every component. Each may reach
DNS (port 53), the in-cluster services it calls, and, where it needs it, the
public internet minus `networkPolicy.egress.privateCidrs`/`privateCidrsV6`
and `extraDeniedCidrs`. That stops a notifier tricked into pushing to a
private address, or a compromised poller, from reaching the rest of the
cluster.

| Component | In-cluster | Public internet (why) |
|---|---|---|
| api | postgres, redis, dev IdP | yes (OIDC discovery and JWKS for `api.sso.issuerUrl` and `api.internalOauth.issuerUrl`) |
| frontend | api | no (the `/chat` Anthropic calls run in the browser) |
| aggregator | postgres | only with `archive.enabled` (S3) |
| enricher | postgres, redis | yes (`enricher.llm.baseUrl`) |
| notifier | postgres | yes (Web Push services) |
| pollers, consumers, movement-relay | api and/or redis, dev IdP | yes (upstream feeds, Kafka, the OAuth token endpoint) |
| schedulefeed | api, dev IdP | yes (the OAuth token endpoint) |
| postgres | none | only with `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled` (the repository's S3) |
| redis | none | no |

`networkPolicy.components.<component>` (keyed by the
`app.kubernetes.io/component` label) tunes one component: `internet`
adds or drops its public-internet rule, and `egress: false` leaves it
without an egress policy. Before enabling, add a rule for anything reached
at a private address: an external Redis or Postgres, an OIDC or OAuth
endpoint inside the cluster or on a tailnet (`100.64.0.0/10`), a private
Kafka broker, LLM endpoint, archive or pgBackRest S3 endpoint, or a proxy.

**Exclude the nodes' own public addresses.** `privateCidrs` names only the
reserved ranges. A node with a public IP is therefore reachable through the
internet rule: the API server (6443), the kubelet (10250) and every port the
host publishes. List those addresses in
`networkPolicy.egress.extraDeniedCidrs` (`/32` or `/128`; IPv4 and IPv6 may
be mixed). They are added to the defaults rather than replacing them, and
because policies are additive, no policy outside the chart can take this
allowance away.

## Distant-Signal-MCP as a service caller

The Distant-Signal-MCP is a separate release (its own `ds-mcp` namespace)
that calls this api's **public** routes in-cluster, directly, not through
the frontend. Without help it would have no `X-Real-IP`, so every MCP user
would share the MCP pod's single anonymous bucket. Instead it proves who it
is with the same internal OAuth2 client-credentials tokens the `/private/*`
callers use, and gets its own, **finite** budget (`api.rateLimit.mcp`, 5x
the public defaults), keyed on the caller (`svc:mcp`, one bucket for the
whole service). It is not exempt: all other validation and timeouts apply,
and a runaway loop or leaked credential is capped by that budget.

On `/Trips/plan`, `/Train/by-uid/*` and non-GET public routes:

| Request | Result |
|---|---|
| No `Authorization: Bearer` | Anonymous, per client IP (unchanged; the frontend never forwards `Authorization`). |
| Bearer verifies and its `groups` contain `api.internalOauth.groups.mcp` | The MCP budget. |
| Bearer fails verification (malformed, expired, bad signature, wrong issuer/audience) | `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`. Never falls back to anonymous. |
| Bearer verifies but lacks the MCP group | `403`, logged with the token's `sub`. |

Login routes ignore the bearer. With `api.internalOauth.groups.mcp` empty
the whole feature is inert and any bearer is ignored. End-user auth is the
session cookie, never `Authorization`, so the bearer does not change who
the request is as far as any handler is concerned. Rejections are counted in
`distant_signal_api_rate_limit_service_auth_rejected_total{class,reason}` and
429s in `distant_signal_api_rate_limited_total{class,caller="mcp"}`.

**What the MCP sends.** Before calling the api (and again before the
token's `exp`), POST a client-credentials grant to the token endpoint:

```
POST <internalOauth.tokenUrl>          # e.g. https://sso.example.com/application/o/token/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<internalOauth.clientId>
&username=<the MCP service account's username>&password=<its app password/token>
&scope=<internalOauth.scope, default "groups">
```

(the same request the pollers make, `crates/common/src/oauth_client.rs`),
then send `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every api call. The
token's `aud` must be `internalOauth.clientId` (the same value as
`api.internalOauth.clientId`), its `iss` must be `api.internalOauth.issuerUrl`,
and its `groups` claim must contain `api.internalOauth.groups.mcp`. Cache
the token until shortly before `exp`; don't fetch one per request. On `401`
refresh the token once; on `429` honour `Retry-After`.

**Operator steps.** In Authentik, under the existing internal-service OAuth2
provider (the one whose client id is `internalOauth.clientId`): create a
service account for the MCP (e.g. `srv-ds-mcp`) and a group of the same name
(`srv-ds-mcp`), add the account to the group, and give the MCP its username
and app password. Do not add it to any `/private/*` caller group. Then, in
this chart's values: set `api.internalOauth.groups.mcp` to that group (the
default is `srv-ds-mcp`), optionally tune `api.rateLimit.mcp`, and, when
`networkPolicy.enabled`, add the MCP's namespace to
`networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressNamespaces` (e.g. `[ds-mcp]`). The default
`networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressPodLabels.ds-mcp` then admits only the MCP pod
(`app.kubernetes.io/name: distant-signal-mcp`,
`app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp`). Change it if your MCP release sets a
`nameOverride`, or add an entry for a namespace with a different name. Any
cluster-level default-deny policy needs the same allowance.

## Enabling the pollers

| Poller | Base URL env var | Ingest path | Default cadence (s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `incidents` | `RDM_INCIDENTS_BASE_URL` | `/private/incidents` | 300 |
| `stations` | `RDM_STATIONS_BASE_URL` | `/private/stations` | 86400 |
| `tocs` | `RDM_TOCS_BASE_URL` | `/private/tocs` | 86400 |
| `ldbws` | `LDBWS_BASE_URL` | `/private/station-samples` | 60 |
| `tfl` | `TFL_BASE_URL` | `/private/tfl-line-status` | 300 |

`ldbws` additionally sets `NUM_ROWS` and `API_SAMPLE_STATIONS_URL`
(`/private/sample-stations`), which is a second api endpoint separate from
its ingest path.

**All five are disabled by default.** The four RDM feeds are real, and
production runs all four, but each base URL and API key comes from the
operator's own Rail Data Marketplace subscription (the repository owner
accepted the RDM terms for the current and planned use on 2026-09-27). The
chart therefore ships no RDM base URL: `pollers.<name>.baseUrl` defaults to
`""`, and `local.env.example` uses non-resolving `*.example.invalid`
placeholders. A default install works immediately instead of running four
pods that cannot authenticate. `tfl` has a working default `baseUrl`
(`https://api.tfl.gov.uk`) but is still off by default; it reads its
subscription key from `TFL_APP_KEY` rather than `RDM_API_KEY`.

The three island-of-Ireland pollers (`pollerIrishRailGtfs`,
`pollerIrishRailLive`, `pollerNirStations`) are separate top-level values,
also off by default, with working public default URLs; see their comments
in `values.yaml`. Each also needs its api-side group,
`api.internalOauth.groups.irishRailGtfs` / `irishRailLive` / `nirStations`,
which is empty by default (no such Authentik group exists until you create
one); enabling one of these pollers with its group empty aborts the render.

Enabling a poller without setting its `baseUrl` **aborts the render** with an
explicit message, rather than deploying a pod that cannot work.

```bash
helm upgrade distant-signal ./charts/distant-signal -n distant-signal \
  --set pollers.incidents.enabled=true \
  --set pollers.incidents.baseUrl=https://rdm.example.com/incidents \
  --set pollers.incidents.apiKey=your-rdm-key

### Global

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `nameOverride` | `""` | Override the chart name used in resource names and labels. |
| `fullnameOverride` | `""` | Override the fully-qualified release name entirely. |
| `imagePullSecrets` | `[]` | Image pull secrets applied to every pod in the chart. |
| `global.imageRegistry` | `""` | Registry (and optional path prefix) put in front of every image in place of the registry its `image.repository` carries, e.g. `registry.example.com/myfork`. Empty keeps each repository as written. |
| `serviceAccount.create` | `true` | Create a ServiceAccount for the chart's workloads. |
| `serviceAccount.name` | `""` | Name to use. Empty + `create` uses the fullname. |
| `serviceAccount.annotations` | `{}` | Annotations for the ServiceAccount (e.g. workload identity). |

### Shared secrets

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `secrets` | `{}` | Reserved for a future chart-wide secret not tied to one service; currently unused. |

`secrets` is currently empty — reserved for any future chart-wide secret
that isn't tied to one specific service. The shared internal-token header
this block used to hold is retired; see "internalOauth (shared,
non-secret)" below for what replaced it.

### internalOauth (shared, non-secret)

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `internalOauth.tokenUrl` | `""` | Authentik's client-credentials token endpoint. Required whenever any real caller is enabled. |
| `internalOauth.clientId` | `""` | The shared OAuth2 Provider's client_id — same value as `api.internalOauth.clientId`. Required. |
| `internalOauth.scope` | `groups` | Scope requested on every client-credentials POST. |

### postgresql

There is intentionally no `replicaCount`: this is a single-replica
StatefulSet with no replication, backup or restore story.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `postgresql.enabled` | `true` | Deploy the bundled PostgreSQL StatefulSet. |
| `postgresql.auth.username` | `distant_signal` | Database role the api and aggregator connect as. |
| `postgresql.auth.database` | `distant_signal` | Database name. |
| `postgresql.auth.password` | `""` | Password. Generated when empty. Percent-encode reserved characters yourself. |
| `postgresql.auth.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the password from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `postgresql.auth.existingSecretPasswordKey` | `postgres-password` | Key within `postgresql.auth.existingSecret`. |
| `postgresql.image.repository` | `postgres` | PostgreSQL image repository. |
| `postgresql.image.tag` | `16.15-trixie@sha256:…` | Postgres 16, the major the compose stack uses, digest-pinned in the tag. |
| `postgresql.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `postgresql.service.port` | `5432` | Port the headless Service and the container listen on. |
| `postgresql.probes.startup.periodSeconds` | `10` | Startup probe period. Liveness starts only after `pg_isready` succeeds, so WAL redo after a reboot is never killed. |
| `postgresql.probes.startup.failureThreshold` | `90` | Startup probe failures allowed (90 x 10s = 15 minutes of crash recovery). |
| `postgresql.persistence.enabled` | `true` | Attach a PVC. When false an emptyDir is used and data is lost on reschedule. |
| `postgresql.persistence.size` | `20Gi` | Requested volume size. |
| `postgresql.persistence.storageClass` | `""` | StorageClass name. Empty means the cluster default. |
| `postgresql.persistence.accessModes` | `[ReadWriteOnce]` | PVC access modes. |
| `postgresql.persistence.existingClaim` | `""` | Use a pre-existing PVC instead of a `volumeClaimTemplates` entry. |
| `postgresql.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra container env vars. Server settings go in `postgresql.config`. |
| `postgresql.config` | see below | `postgresql.conf` settings, rendered as `-c name=value` args. Sized for the default 5Gi limit. A `null` key falls back to the Postgres default. Changing it restarts Postgres. |
| `postgresql.shm.enabled` | `true` | Mount a memory-backed emptyDir at `/dev/shm` (the runtime default is 64MiB). |
| `postgresql.shm.sizeLimit` | `1Gi` | Size of `/dev/shm`. Empty means unbounded apart from the memory limit. |
| `postgresql.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the pod securityContext. uid/gid/fsGroup 999 are pinned by default and required by this image. |
| `postgresql.resources` | requests `250m`/`3Gi`, limit `5Gi` | Container resource requests/limits. The `config` and `shm` defaults assume the 5Gi limit. |
| `postgresql.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `postgresql.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `postgresql.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `postgresql.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `postgresql.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | `""` | Seconds Kubernetes waits after the stop signal (a fast shutdown) before SIGKILL. Empty: unset (Kubernetes' 30s) with pgBackRest off; with it on, 6 x `pgbackrest.archive.pushTimeoutSecs` + 60 (240), since a stop while S3 is unreachable waits for the archiver. |

#### Postgres memory and checkpoint tuning

`postgresql.config` is merged key by key over these defaults, so an
override only needs to name the keys it changes:

| Setting | Chart default | Postgres default | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shared_buffers` | `1GB` | `128MB` | About 20% of the 5Gi limit. |
| `effective_cache_size` | `3584MB` | `4GB` | Planner hint only, about 70% of the limit. |
| `work_mem` | `16MB` | `4MB` | Per sort/hash node. Hash nodes may use twice this (`hash_mem_multiplier`). |
| `maintenance_work_mem` | `256MB` | `64MB` | Manual VACUUM, CREATE INDEX. |
| `autovacuum_work_mem` | `128MB` | `-1` (= `maintenance_work_mem`) | Per autovacuum worker (3). Decoupled so maintenance bumps don't triple. |
| `wal_buffers` | `32MB` | `-1` (shared_buffers/32, max 16MB) | Bulk schedule publishes fill small WAL buffers. |
| `max_wal_size` | `4GB` | `1GB` | Fewer size-triggered checkpoints during bulk writes. Needs up to this much `pg_wal` disk. |
| `min_wal_size` | `1GB` | `80MB` | Keeps WAL segments recycled rather than deleted and recreated. |
| `checkpoint_timeout` | `15min` | `5min` | Fewer full-page images. Crash recovery takes longer. |
| `wal_compression` | `lz4` | `off` | Compresses the full-page images written after each checkpoint. Needs Postgres 15+ built with lz4 (the chart's `postgres:16` image is). |
| `random_page_cost` | `1.1` | `4` | **Assumes SSD-class storage.** Set `"4"` on spinning disks. |
| `huge_pages` | `off` | `try` | The pod requests no hugepages. `try` can SIGBUS on nodes where hugepages exist but aren't granted to the pod. |
| `shared_preload_libraries` | `pg_stat_statements` | `""` | Per-query statistics. Only loads at server start. The extension is created by migration `20260927070000`. |
| `pg_stat_statements.track` | `top` | `top` | Top-level statements only. Pinned explicitly. |
| `log_min_duration_statement` | `1s` | `-1` | Logs statements taking 1s or more. Expect one line per schedule-publish bulk batch. |
| `log_parameter_max_length` | `0` | `-1` | Never log bind parameters: bulk arrays of ~250k rows, user data, session tokens. |
| `log_lock_waits` | `on` | `off` | Logs lock waits longer than `deadlock_timeout` (1s). |
| `track_io_timing` | `on` | `off` | I/O timings in `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_database`. |

`random_page_cost` defaults to `"1.1"`, which assumes SSD-class storage
(SSD/NVMe, or network block storage backed by it, as most managed
StorageClasses are). On spinning disks set it back to `"4"`, Postgres's
own default. If you change `resources.limits.memory`, scale
`shared_buffers` (~20-25%), `effective_cache_size` (~70%) and
`postgresql.shm.sizeLimit` with it. If you raise
`maintenance_work_mem` or `work_mem`, raise `postgresql.shm.sizeLimit` too:
a parallel VACUUM keeps its whole dead-tuple array (up to
`maintenance_work_mem`) in `/dev/shm`. With the runtime default of 64MiB,
that fails with `could not resize shared memory segment ... No space left
on device`. Memory used in `/dev/shm` counts against the container's
memory limit.

The settings are passed on the command line, so they override both
`postgresql.conf` and `ALTER SYSTEM`. They are part of the pod template,
so changing any of them rolls the StatefulSet (`RollingUpdate`, one pod).
Postgres restarts, which `shared_buffers`, `wal_buffers` and `huge_pages`
need anyway. Expect a short outage. Postgres stops cleanly (the image's
SIGINT stop signal requests a fast shutdown), then starts with a cold
buffer cache. Because the pod template carries the `helm.sh/chart` and
`app.kubernetes.io/version` labels, **every chart upgrade restarts
Postgres anyway**, even when these settings don't change. No config
checksum annotation is needed.

#### Observability settings (2026-09-27)

`shared_preload_libraries` only takes effect when Postgres restarts. Any
change to `postgresql.config` rolls the StatefulSet, so the upgrade that
adds it restarts Postgres. An override that sets its own `postgresql.config`
keeps these defaults unless it names the same keys, because the keys merge.
On an external database, set the same parameters in its own configuration.
The migration creates the extension only if the app role is allowed to, and
logs a warning otherwise. In that case, run
`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;` as a privileged role.

#### Connection pools and timeouts

Every pool (api, aggregator, notifier, enricher) sets these at connect time
(`crates/common/src/pg.rs`):

- `application_name`: `distant-signal-api`, `-aggregator`, `-notifier`,
  `-enricher`, or `-api-migrations`.
- `statement_timeout`, from `databasePool.statementTimeoutSecs` (60).
- `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, from
  `databasePool.idleInTransactionTimeoutSecs` (30).

A pool acquire fails after `databasePool.acquireTimeoutSecs` (5).

Some work is expected to run longer and raises `statement_timeout` for its
own transaction with `SET LOCAL`:

| Work | `statement_timeout` |
|---|---|
| Schedule publish chunks | 120s |
| Final-chunk delete phase | 120s |
| Retention prunes | 600s |
| Archive batches | 600s, plus 15min idle-in-transaction |

api migrates at startup on its own connection, with
`api.migrations.lockTimeoutSecs` (10) and
`api.migrations.statementTimeoutSecs` (240, well below the 900s startup-probe
budget). Before it migrates, it drops any INVALID index that a failed
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` left behind.

| Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `databasePool.statementTimeoutSecs` | `60` | `statement_timeout` for every pooled connection. `0` disables it. |
| `databasePool.idleInTransactionTimeoutSecs` | `30` | `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`. `0` disables it. |
| `databasePool.acquireTimeoutSecs` | `5` | How long to wait for a free pool connection. |
| `api.database.maxConnections` | `50` | api pool size per replica. Pools total api 50 per replica + aggregator 10 + notifier 5 + enricher 5 = 70 at one api replica, against Postgres's default `max_connections` of 100 (the chart does not raise it). Each extra api replica adds 50: before scaling to 2 replicas, raise `postgresql.config.max_connections` (restart; check memory) or lower this. |
| `api.migrations.lockTimeoutSecs` | `10` | `lock_timeout` for startup migrations. |
| `api.migrations.statementTimeoutSecs` | `240` | `statement_timeout` for each startup migration statement. Keep it below the startup probe budget. |

#### pgBackRest (point-in-time recovery)

Off by default. See [Point-in-time recovery (optional)](#point-in-time-recovery-optional)
and [docs/postgres-pitr.md](../../docs/postgres-pitr.md).

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled` | `false` | Turn on WAL archiving, backups and checks with pgBackRest. Needs `postgresql.enabled`. Turning it on or off restarts Postgres once. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/postgres-pgbackrest` | The Postgres-plus-pgBackRest image (`docker/postgres-pgbackrest.Dockerfile`), as `containers.yml` publishes it. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.tag` | `""` | **Required when enabled**: the stable tag with its digest, e.g. `pg16.15-pgbackrest2.59.1-tini0.19.0@sha256:…` (only `-tini` tags: see docs/postgres-pitr.md, "Why tini"). Never falls back to `appVersion`: a per-release image would restart Postgres on every deploy. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.digest` | `""` | Content digest, used instead of `tag` when set. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.stanza` | `ds` | pgBackRest stanza name. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.processMax` | `2` | Parallel processes for async archive-push, backup and restore. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.path` | `""` | **Required when enabled**: absolute repository path in the bucket, e.g. `/mine-bringer/pgbackrest/distant-signal`. `expire` deletes under it only. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.retentionFullType` | `time` | `time`: keep what's needed to restore to any point in the last `retentionFull` days. `count`: keep that many full backups. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.retentionFull` | `7` | Days (or full backups). Backups hold personal data until they expire, so keep it short. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.bundle` | `true` | Bundle small files into fewer repository objects. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.endpoint` | `""` | **Required when enabled**: S3 endpoint host name, no scheme. Also the TLS name that is verified. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.port` | `443` | Endpoint port. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.storageHost` | `""` | Connect to this host instead of `endpoint`, which is still used for TLS and signing. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.bucket` | `""` | **Required when enabled**: bucket name. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.region` | `us-east-1` | Region requests are signed for. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.uriStyle` | `path` | `path` or `host` (virtual-hosted) addressing. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.verifyTls` | `true` | Verify the endpoint's certificate. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.existingSecret` | `""` | **Required when enabled**: existing Secret with the S3 key pair (and, by default, the cipher passphrase). |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.s3.accessKeyIdKey` / `.secretAccessKeyKey` | `access-key-id` / `secret-access-key` | Keys within `repo.s3.existingSecret`. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.cipher.type` | `aes-256-cbc` | Client-side repository encryption. Can't be empty. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.cipher.existingSecret` | `""` | Existing Secret with the cipher passphrase. Empty means `repo.s3.existingSecret`. Keep an offline copy of the passphrase. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.repo.cipher.passphraseKey` | `cipher-pass` | Key within that Secret. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.archive.async` | `true` | Asynchronous, parallel archive-push through a spool on the data volume. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.archive.queueMax` | `8GB` | Disk-full guard (`archive-push-queue-max`): past this much queued WAL, pgBackRest drops WAL (a PITR gap the daily check reports) instead of filling the disk. Base-1024 units. Needs `async`; `""` turns it off. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.archive.timeoutSecs` | `60` | Postgres `archive_timeout`: bounds the recovery point objective while anything writes. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.archive.pushTimeoutSecs` | `30` | pgBackRest `archive-timeout` for `archive_command` only (backup and check keep 60s): how long each archive-push waits for the async worker. Sets the default grace period and `PGCTLTIMEOUT` (6 x this + 60). Changing it restarts Postgres. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.compress.type` / `.level` | `zst` / `3` | Repository compression. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.timeZone` | `Etc/UTC` | `spec.timeZone` of the CronJobs. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.fullSchedule` | `0 5 * * 0` | Weekly full backup (Sunday 05:00 UTC). |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.diffSchedule` | `0 5 * * 1-6` | Differential backup the other days (05:00 UTC). |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.checkSchedule` | `0 7 * * *` | Daily `check` and WAL gap check (07:00 UTC, after the backup). |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.verifySchedule` | `0 8 * * 0` | Weekly `pgbackrest verify` CronJob (Sunday 08:00 UTC, after the full backup). It reads the whole repository back. Empty renders no verify CronJob. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.suspend` | `false` | Suspend the CronJobs (archiving continues). |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.activeDeadlineSeconds` | `21600` | Kill a backup or check Job that runs longer. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.backoffLimit` | `1` | Retries of a failed Job. A retried backup resumes. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.startingDeadlineSeconds` | `3600` | Skip a run that can't start within this long of its time. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.image.repository` / `.tag` / `.pullPolicy` | `registry.k8s.io/kubectl`, `v1.36.5@sha256:…`, `IfNotPresent` | The image the CronJobs run `kubectl exec` from. Keep it within one minor version of the cluster. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.resources` | requests `20m`/`32Mi`, limit `128Mi` | CronJob pod resources. The work happens in the Postgres container. |
| `postgresql.pgbackrest.backup.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the CronJob pods' securityContext (non-root uid 65532 by default). |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.pgbackrest` | see `values.yaml` | The pgBackRest alerts' windows, ages, `archiverSelector` and severity (see [Alerts](#alerts)). |

### externalDatabase

Used only when `postgresql.enabled` is `false`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `externalDatabase.url` | `""` | Full connection URL, e.g. `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/distant_signal`. |
| `externalDatabase.existingSecret` | `""` | Pre-existing Secret holding the whole connection URL (preferred). |
| `externalDatabase.existingSecretUrlKey` | `database-url` | Key within `externalDatabase.existingSecret`. |

### api

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/api` | api image repository. |
| `api.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `api.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). When set, takes priority over `tag`/appVersion -- see "Pinning by content digest instead of tag" above. CI populates this automatically for images it builds and pushes. |
| `api.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `api.replicaCount` | `1` | Replicas. >1 is safe for migrations — sqlx's Migrator takes a Postgres advisory lock — but each replica adds `api.database.maxConnections` (50) connections: see that row before scaling. |
| `api.service.type` | `ClusterIP` | Service type. |
| `api.service.port` | `8080` | Service and container port; also sets `BIND_URL`. |
| `api.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value (tracing-subscriber EnvFilter syntax). |
| `api.sso.issuerUrl` | `""` | **Required.** OIDC issuer base URL; everything else is discovered from its `.well-known/openid-configuration`. |
| `api.sso.clientId` | `""` | **Required.** OIDC client id this deployment is registered as. |
| `api.sso.clientSecret` | `""` | **Required** unless `api.sso.existingSecret` is set. Rendered into the chart Secret as `sso-client-secret`. Never auto-generated. |
| `api.sso.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the client secret from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `api.sso.existingSecretClientSecretKey` | `sso-client-secret` | Key within `api.sso.existingSecret`. |
| `api.sso.redirectUrl` | `""` | **Required.** Callback URI registered with the SSO server — the *frontend's* origin plus `/api/auth/callback`, not the api's. |
| `api.sso.postLoginRedirectUrl` | `""` | **Required.** Where sign-in and sign-out send the browser afterwards — the frontend's root URL. |
| `api.sessionTtlDays` | `14` | Session lifetime in days. A fixed expiry stamped at sign-in, not a sliding window. |
| `api.internalOauth.issuerUrl` | `""` | **Required.** OIDC issuer base URL for the internal-service OAuth2 provider (may be the same Authentik instance as `api.sso.*`, a different Application/Provider). |
| `api.internalOauth.clientId` | `""` | **Required.** Expected `aud` claim on a verified token — same value as the top-level `internalOauth.clientId`. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.incidents` | `svc-poller-incidents` | Required Authentik group for the incidents poller. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.stations` | `svc-poller-stations` | Required Authentik group for the stations poller. Not secret. |

| `api.internalOauth.groups.trustConsumer` | `svc-trust-consumer` | Required Authentik group for trust-consumer (also accepted on `GET /private/stanox-crs`). Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.scheduleIngest` | `svc-schedule-ingest` | Required Authentik group for schedule-ingest. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.scheduleReference` | `svc-schedule-reference` | Required Authentik group for schedule-reference (also accepted on `POST /private/stanox-crs`). Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.fullCoverage` | `svc-full-coverage-consumer` | Required Authentik group for full-coverage-consumer. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.trustBacklog` | `svc-trust-backlog-consumer` | Required Authentik group for trust-backlog-consumer. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.irishRailGtfs` | `""` | Authentik group for the Irish Rail GTFS poller. Empty (the default) closes its api routes; required when `pollerIrishRailGtfs.enabled`. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.irishRailLive` | `""` | Authentik group for the Irish Rail realtime poller. Empty (the default) closes its api route; required when `pollerIrishRailLive.enabled`. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.nirStations` | `""` | Authentik group for the NIR stations poller. Empty (the default) closes its api routes; required when `pollerNirStations.enabled`. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.corpus` | `svc-corpus-ingest` | Required Authentik group on `POST /private/corpus-locations` (Network Rail CORPUS loads). Add the schedule-ingest service account to it before setting `scheduleFeed.corpus.enabled`. Not secret. |
| `api.internalOauth.groups.mcp` | `srv-ds-mcp` | Authentik group of the Distant-Signal-MCP's service account. Opens no `/private/*` route: it only moves the MCP's public requests onto `api.rateLimit.mcp`. Empty turns that off. Must differ from every other group (api refuses to start otherwise). See "Distant-Signal-MCP as a service caller" below. |
| `api.rateLimit.enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the per-client limits on login, `/Trips/plan`, `/Train/by-uid/*` and public writes (`crates/api/src/rate_limit.rs`). `/private/*` is never limited. |
| `api.rateLimit.trustXRealIp` | `true` | Key anonymous clients on the frontend proxy's `X-Real-IP`. Safe only while `ingress.api.enabled` is off. |
| `api.rateLimit.login.perMinute` / `.burst` | `10` / `20` | Per client IP, `/public/auth/login` and `/public/auth/callback`. |
| `api.rateLimit.tripPlan.perMinute` / `.burst` | `20` / `10` | Per client IP, `/Trips/plan`. |
| `api.rateLimit.trainByUid.perMinute` / `.burst` | `120` / `60` | Per client IP, `/Train/by-uid/*`. |
| `api.rateLimit.publicWrite.perMinute` / `.burst` | `120` / `60` | Per client IP, every other non-GET public route. |
| `api.rateLimit.mcp.tripPlan.perMinute` / `.burst` | `100` / `30` | The MCP's own `/Trips/plan` budget: one bucket for the whole service (`svc:mcp`), 5x public. |
| `api.rateLimit.mcp.trainByUid.perMinute` / `.burst` | `600` / `200` | The MCP's own `/Train/by-uid/*` budget. |
| `api.rateLimit.mcp.publicWrite.perMinute` / `.burst` | `600` / `200` | The MCP's own public-write budget. Login has no MCP budget: the bearer is ignored there. |
| `api.probes.path` | `/public/health` | Path all three probes and the `helm test` pod hit. |
| `api.probes.startup.periodSeconds` | `2` | Startup probe period. |
| `api.probes.startup.failureThreshold` | `450` | Startup probe failures allowed (450 x 2s = 900s for in-process migrations, matching the Postgres startupProbe's 15 minutes). |
| `api.probes.startup.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Startup probe timeout. |
| `api.probes.readiness.periodSeconds` | `10` | Readiness probe period. |
| `api.probes.readiness.failureThreshold` | `3` | Readiness probe failures allowed. |
| `api.probes.readiness.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Readiness probe timeout. |
| `api.probes.liveness.periodSeconds` | `10` | Liveness probe period. |
| `api.probes.liveness.failureThreshold` | `3` | Liveness probe failures allowed. |
| `api.probes.liveness.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Liveness probe timeout. |
| `api.reconciliationSweepIntervalSecs` | `300` | How often the reconciliation sweep retries fixing a stuck tracked-train row. |
| `api.scheduleEnrichmentGraceMinutes` | `30` | How long past a train's origin departure the reconciliation sweep waits before trying a schedule-only match. |
| `api.backlogMatchSweepIntervalSecs` | `300` | How often still-pending pins are matched against the TRUST event backlog. |
| `api.sessionCleanupIntervalSecs` | `3600` | How often expired sessions are deleted; the personal-data retention limits below run on the same sweep. |
| `api.pastTravelRetentionDays` | `548` | Days after the travel date that tracked trains, tickets, journeys and template skip markers are kept (18 months). `0` disables. See `docs/personal-data-retention.md`. |
| `api.stalePushSubscriptionDays` | `365` | Drop push subscriptions whose user has not logged in (and that were not renewed) for this many days. `0` disables. |
| `api.inactiveAccountRetentionDays` | `0` | Delete accounts with no login and no live session for this many days. Off by default: the app holds no email addresses, so users cannot be warned first, and enabling it is an operator decision the privacy notice must state. |
| `api.chatbotAccessGroup` | `distant-signal-chatbot-users` | SSO group (from the `groups` OIDC claim) that grants a logged-in user the embedded chatbot. Only read when `api.chatbotAccess` is `group`; there, `""` means nobody gets it. |
| `api.chatbotAccess` | `group` | Who gets the embedded chatbot: `group` (members of `api.chatbotAccessGroup` only) or `authenticated` (every logged-in user; logged-out visitors still get the sign-in prompt, and `chatbotAccessGroup` is ignored and no longer stored). Flip it together with distant-signal-mcp's own ungating. |
| `api.adminGroup` | `""` | SSO group whose members may end any user's sessions (`POST /api/admin/users/revoke-sessions`). Empty: nobody is an admin. Read at login. See `docs/session-revocation.md`. |
| `api.oidcStoredGroupsExtra` | `""` | Extra IdP groups kept on the user at login besides `chatbotAccessGroup` and `adminGroup`; every other group is dropped. Comma-separated; `""` keeps none. Nothing reads extra groups today: distant-signal-mcp takes its groups straight from Authentik. |
| `api.timeouts.requestTimeoutSecs` | `30` | Public requests still running after this get a 408. |
| `api.timeouts.privateRequestTimeoutSecs` | `300` | The same for the `/private` ingest routes, which take bodies up to 100 MB. |
| `api.timeouts.headerReadTimeoutSecs` | `10` | Disconnect an HTTP/1 client that has not sent its full headers within this. |
| `api.corpusFallback.enabled` | `false` | Use Network Rail CORPUS as a fallback for TIPLOC/STANOX→CRS lookups the timetable has no CRS for; the timetable always wins a conflict. Does nothing until CORPUS is loaded (`scheduleFeed.corpus.enabled`). Review `corpus_compare` (in the api image) first. |
| `api.tripPlanGraphCache.dates` | `2` | Service dates whose connections graph `/Trips/plan` keeps built (about 100 MB each). `0` disables the cache. |
| `api.tripPlanGraphCache.maxAgeSecs` | `600` | Rebuild a cached graph after this long, or after a new schedule publish. |
| `api.tripPlanMaxWaypoints` | `20` | Most `?waypoints=` one `/Trips/plan` request may name (clamped to 1-20). |
| `api.tripPlanLive.enabled` | `true` | Apply TRUST and Darwin data to `/Trips/plan` for today's and yesterday's service dates: cancelled trains and calls are withdrawn, known delays applied, and the plan re-run. `false` is the kill-switch: every plan is timetable-only, as with `?live=false`. |
| `api.tripPlanLive.maxReplans` | `3` | Extra planning passes per `results=fastest` request when newly read live data changes the plan. |
| `api.tripPlanLive.maxReplansOptions` | `1` | The same for `results=options` (RAPTOR, the expensive pass); 1 keeps the worst case near 1 s. |
| `api.tripPlanLive.trustMaxAgeMinutes` | `30` | Ignore a TRUST delay whose train state was last updated longer ago than this. Actual times and cancellations are always used. |
| `api.tripPlanLive.horizonMinutes` / `.lookbackMinutes` | `180` / `120` | Only legs booked to depart between `lookbackMinutes` ago and `horizonMinutes` ahead get live data. |
| `api.tripPlanLive.maxTrains` | `60` | Most trains whose live data one request reads. |
| `api.fullCoverageEnabledDefault` | `true` | Treat every catalogued line as `full_coverage_enabled`, whatever its `lines/*.toml` entry says, so TRUST-vs-schedule delay and cancellation data is used everywhere. Set `aggregator.fullCoverageEnabledDefault` to the same value: both services gate on it. |
| `api.malloc.arenaMax` | `"2"` | `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`: caps glibc's retained per-arena memory. |
| `api.malloc.mmapThreshold` | `"131072"` | `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_` in bytes: allocations at least this large are returned to the OS on free. |
| `api.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `api.resources` | requests `200m`/`1Gi`, limit `3Gi` | Container resource requests/limits. Deliberately generous, stopgap-derived sizes (production's OOM-era overrides); the raw-JSON population relay, ETag reloads and `api.malloc` tuning should bring real usage well below them. Resize from live `kubectl top`. |
| `api.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `api.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `api.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `api.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `api.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### devAuthentik

See "Local dev identity provider (devAuthentik)" above. Always off by
default; nothing here is rendered unless `devAuthentik.enabled` is `true`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `devAuthentik.enabled` | `false` | Deploy a throwaway local Authentik instance for exercising this app's own login flow. An install pointing `api.sso.*` at a real external IdP is unaffected either way. |
| `devAuthentik.hostname` | `authentik.localhost` | The one hostname both the developer's browser and the api Pod must resolve identically. Resolves to loopback with no `/etc/hosts` entry needed in modern browsers (RFC 6761). |
| `devAuthentik.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/goauthentik/server` | Authentik server image repository. |
| `devAuthentik.image.tag` | `2026.8.0@sha256:…` | Pinned (digest in the tag); Authentik's ~3-month release cadence and 2-version support window mean this needs periodic bumping, not automated by this chart. |
| `devAuthentik.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `devAuthentik.secretKey` | `""` | `AUTHENTIK_SECRET_KEY`. Chart-generated (lookup-then-`randAlphaNum`) when empty, same pattern as `postgres-password`, so it survives `helm upgrade`. No `existingSecret` override — throwaway dev IdP only. |
| `devAuthentik.service.port` | `30900` | ClusterIP-facing port. Must equal `service.nodePort` — the render aborts if they differ. |
| `devAuthentik.service.nodePort` | `30900` | NodePort. Must equal `service.port`; default sits inside Kubernetes' default 30000-32767 NodePort range. |
| `devAuthentik.hostAliasIP` | `""` | Explicit override for the IP the api Deployment's `hostAliases` entry points `devAuthentik.hostname` at. Empty uses `lookup` against the live Service's ClusterIP at render time — unresolvable on a from-scratch `helm install` (see the "Two manual steps" note above and NOTES.txt). |
| `devAuthentik.postgresql.image` | `postgres:16.15-alpine@sha256:…` | Image for Authentik's own dedicated Postgres — independent of, and not a second database on, this chart's bundled `postgresql`. |
| `devAuthentik.postgresql.persistence.enabled` | `true` | Attach a PVC for Authentik's Postgres. |
| `devAuthentik.postgresql.persistence.size` | `1Gi` | Requested volume size. |
| `devAuthentik.postgresql.persistence.storageClass` | `""` | StorageClass name. Empty means the cluster default. |
| `devAuthentik.postgresql.resources` | requests `50m`/`128Mi`, limit `512Mi` | Authentik Postgres container resource requests/limits. |
| `devAuthentik.resources` | requests `100m`/`256Mi`, limit `1Gi` | Authentik server container resource requests/limits. |
| `devAuthentik.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `devAuthentik.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `devAuthentik.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |

### aggregator

There is intentionally no `replicaCount`: the aggregator is a singleton
write loop, pinned to `replicas: 1` with `strategy: Recreate`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `aggregator.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/aggregator` | aggregator image repository. |
| `aggregator.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `aggregator.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `aggregator.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `aggregator.pollIntervalSecs` | `60` | Recompute cadence. |
| `aggregator.historyRetentionDays` | `7` | How long `line_status_history` rows are kept. |
| `aggregator.progressStallSecs` | `1800` | `/livez` stall window (see `workerHealth`): one aggregation pass. |
| `aggregator.dailyStatsRetentionDays` | `300` | Days `line_status_daily_stats` (LDBWS-derived) rows are kept. Must stay under 365: the RDM Live Departure Board licence requires deleting received data within a year. |
| `aggregator.halfHourlyStatsRetentionHours` | `840` | Hours `line_status_half_hourly_stats` rows are kept (35 days). |
| `aggregator.fullCoverageEnabledDefault` | `true` | See `api.fullCoverageEnabledDefault`; set both to the same value. |
| `aggregator.fullCoverageWindow.mode` | `off` | Windowed full-coverage severity: `off`, `shadow` (record a verdict per line, change nothing) or `enforce` (also escalate the lines in `enforceLines`). |
| `aggregator.fullCoverageWindow.enforceLines` | `""` | Lines `enforce` may change: comma list, or `*` for every full-coverage-enabled line. Empty enforces nothing. |
| `aggregator.fullCoverageWindow.minEscalationRank` | `4` | Only verdicts of at least this severity rank are enforced (4 is Severe Delays / Part Suspended). |
| `aggregator.fullCoverageWindow.retentionDays` | `14` | Days window stats and verdicts are kept (pruned in every mode). |
| `aggregator.trustEventBacklogRetentionDays` | `1` | Days `trust_event_backlog` rows are kept. Deliberately 1: a TRUST licensing safeguard. |
| `aggregator.scheduleDestinationDeparturesRetentionDays` | `8` | Service dates of `schedule_destination_departures` kept (about 377,000 rows a day); covers the train search's 7-day backward window. |
| `aggregator.trainsRetentionDays` | `30` | Days a `trains` row (with its movement events and current state) is kept when a user tracked it. |
| `aggregator.untrackedTrainsRetentionDays` | `14` | Days a `trains` row is kept when nobody tracked it. |
| `aggregator.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `aggregator.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `aggregator.resources` | requests `100m`/`256Mi`, limit `384Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `aggregator.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `aggregator.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `aggregator.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `aggregator.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `aggregator.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### archive

Cold archive of pruned rows to S3-compatible storage, run by the aggregator.
See "Cold archive (optional)" above and `docs/cold-archive.md`. Off by
default; nothing here is rendered unless `archive.enabled` is `true`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `archive.enabled` | `false` | Upload rows to S3 before the aggregator's retention prune deletes them. |
| `archive.tables` | `[trains]` | Tables to archive (explicit opt-in). `trains` archives each trains row with its movement events (without `raw_body`) and current state. `trust_event_backlog` and every LDBWS-derived table are refused: their retention is a licensing safeguard. |
| `archive.failurePolicy` | `retain` | On a failed upload: `retain` keeps the rows and retries next cycle; `delete` prunes them unarchived. |
| `archive.s3.endpoint` | `""` | S3 endpoint URL. Empty means AWS's regional endpoint. |
| `archive.s3.bucket` | `""` | **Required** when enabled. |
| `archive.s3.prefix` | `""` | Key prefix inside the bucket, e.g. `distant-signal/archive`. |
| `archive.s3.region` | `us-east-1` | Region used for request signing; most non-AWS servers accept any value. |
| `archive.s3.pathStyle` | `true` | Path-style addressing (`https://endpoint/bucket/key`), which most non-AWS servers need. `false` is virtual-hosted style. |
| `archive.s3.allowHttp` | `false` | Permit a plain `http://` endpoint. |
| `archive.s3.lifecycleConfirmed` | `false` | When enabled, this or `archive.expiry.enabled` **must be `true`**, or the render fails. Confirms the bucket has an S3 lifecycle expiration rule: the archiver itself never deletes an object. |
| `archive.s3.existingSecret` | `""` | **Required** when enabled: pre-existing Secret holding the access key pair. The chart never renders these credentials. |
| `archive.s3.accessKeyIdKey` | `access-key-id` | Key within `archive.s3.existingSecret` for the access key id. |
| `archive.s3.secretAccessKeyKey` | `secret-access-key` | Key within `archive.s3.existingSecret` for the secret access key. |
| `archive.expiry.enabled` | `false` | Client-side expiry of archived objects by the aggregator, for stores with no lifecycle API (Thoth). Needs `archive.enabled` and an `archive.s3.prefix` of at least two path segments. Satisfies the `lifecycleConfirmed` gate. Deletes only keys matching `<prefix>/<table>/service_date=YYYY-MM-DD/part-<19 digits>.jsonl.zst`, dated by the key, never by `LastModified`. |
| `archive.expiry.dryRun` | `true` | Log and count what would be deleted (`aggregator_archive_expiry_would_delete`), delete nothing. Set `false` only after checking the dry-run metrics. |
| `archive.expiry.retentionDays` | `730` | Keep objects whose key `service_date` is at most this many rail days old. Anything under 90 fails the render and the aggregator's startup; that floor is fixed in code. |
| `archive.expiry.intervalSecs` | `86400` | Seconds between expiry runs; the first runs at aggregator startup. |
| `archive.expiry.maxDeletesPerRun` | `20000` | Most objects one run deletes (or would delete), oldest date first. Hitting it bumps `aggregator_archive_expiry_cap_reached_total`. |
| `archive.expiry.protectedPrefixes` | `[]` | `ARCHIVE_PROTECTED_PREFIXES`: key prefixes the archive prefix must never equal, contain or sit inside (e.g. `mine-bringer/backups/`). The aggregator refuses to start on an overlap. |

### notifier

Web Push for pinned lines, tracked trains and journeys. A singleton loop
(`replicas: 1`, `strategy: Recreate`): two replicas would send every push
twice.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `notifier.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/notifier` | notifier image repository. |
| `notifier.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `notifier.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `notifier.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `notifier.progressStallSecs` | `900` | `/livez` stall window (`PROGRESS_STALL_SECS`, see `workerHealth`). |
| `notifier.pollIntervalSecs` | `60` | How often line status and tracked trains are polled for changes. |
| `notifier.cooldownMinutes` | `20` | How long a de-escalation or lateral line notification is suppressed after the last one sent to the same user for the same line. |
| `notifier.trainDelayThresholdMinutes` | `15` | Delay, in minutes, at or above which a tracked train's delay is worth a notification. |
| `notifier.cursorGraceSeconds` | `120` | How long a cursor watermark proposal must age before it is promoted to the cursor's `last_processed_id`. |
| `notifier.forwardQueuePollIntervalSecs` | `15` | Poll cadence for the forwarding queue (notifications api hands over), faster than `pollIntervalSecs`. |
| `notifier.skipCheckPollIntervalSecs` | `90` | Cadence of the station-skip check for tracked journeys. |
| `notifier.templateSweepPollIntervalSecs` | `3600` | Cadence of the recurring-journey materialisation sweep. |
| `notifier.autoCommitLeadMinutes` | `120` | Lead time, in minutes, for the commit check on `auto`-mode journey legs. |
| `notifier.push.workers` | `8` | Notifications sent at once (each fans out to all of that user's subscriptions). |
| `notifier.push.queueCapacity` | `1024` | Notifications waiting for a worker. Beyond this new ones are dropped (`distant_signal_notifier_push_dropped_total`). |
| `notifier.push.perUserInFlight` | `2` | At most this many of one user's notifications in flight, so one user's slow endpoints cannot take the whole pool. |
| `notifier.push.perUserQueued` | `64` | At most this many of one user's notifications waiting. |
| `notifier.push.pruneAfterTimeouts` | `3` | Delete a subscription after this many consecutive timeouts (in-memory count, reset on restart). |
| `notifier.push.shutdownGraceSecs` | `20` | On SIGTERM, seconds to let queued and in-flight pushes finish. |
| `notifier.vapid.subject` | `""` | `mailto:` or `https:` contact for the VAPID `sub` claim (RFC 8292). |
| `notifier.vapid.publicKey` | `""` | VAPID public key (uncompressed, base64url). Must pair with `privateKey`: generate with `openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1`. Never auto-generated. |
| `notifier.vapid.privateKey` | `""` | VAPID private key (PEM EC). Never auto-generated. |
| `notifier.vapid.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the VAPID key pair from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `notifier.vapid.existingSecretPublicKeyKey` | `vapid-public-key` | Key within `notifier.vapid.existingSecret` for the public key. |
| `notifier.vapid.existingSecretPrivateKeyKey` | `vapid-private-key` | Key within `notifier.vapid.existingSecret` for the private key. |
| `notifier.logLevel` | `info` | `LOG_LEVEL` value. |
| `notifier.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `notifier.resources` | requests `50m`/`128Mi`, limit `384Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `notifier.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `notifier.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `notifier.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `notifier.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `notifier.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### redis

There is intentionally no `replicaCount`: this is a single, non-clustered
instance (Deployment+PVC, not a StatefulSet — see redis-deployment.yaml's
own comment for why). See "Using an external Redis" above for what it's
used for and why persistence defaults on.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `redis.enabled` | `true` | Deploy the bundled Redis Deployment and Service. |
| `redis.externalUrl` | `""` | Connection URL of an externally-managed Redis. Used only when `redis.enabled` is false, where it is **required** — empty aborts the render. |
| `redis.auth.enabled` | `false` | Redis AUTH: give every Redis client `REDIS_PASSWORD` from a Secret. See "Redis authentication (optional)". |
| `redis.auth.requirePass` | `true` | With `auth.enabled` and the bundled Redis, start it with `--requirepass` and authenticate its probes. `false` is step 1 of the no-outage enable sequence. |
| `redis.auth.existingSecret` | `""` | Secret holding the password. Empty: the chart generates `redis-password` in its own Secret (bundled Redis only; an external Redis requires this). |
| `redis.auth.existingSecretKey` | `redis-password` | Key within `redis.auth.existingSecret`. |
| `redis.image.repository` | `redis` | Redis image repository (upstream image; this repo builds no Redis image). |
| `redis.image.tag` | `7.4.11@sha256:…` | Redis 7.4, digest-pinned in the tag. |
| `redis.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `redis.service.port` | `6379` | Service and container port; also sets the `REDIS_URL` every Redis client (api, enricher, the three consumers, movement-relay) gets. |
| `redis.persistence.enabled` | `true` | Attach a PVC and run redis with `--appendonly yes`. When false an emptyDir is used and data is lost on reschedule. |
| `redis.persistence.size` | `4Gi` | Requested volume size. The AOF can reach 1-2 GB at the default `maxmemory` (see Sizing above). An existing PVC on a non-expandable StorageClass keeps its size; read the [Upgrade](#upgrade) note before upgrading from a 1Gi install. |
| `redis.persistence.storageClass` | `""` | StorageClass name. Empty means the cluster default. |
| `redis.persistence.accessModes` | `[ReadWriteOnce]` | PVC access modes. |
| `redis.persistence.existingClaim` | `""` | Use a pre-existing PVC instead of a chart-rendered one. |
| `redis.maxmemory` | `1536mb` | Passed as `--maxmemory`. With `noeviction`, a full Redis refuses writes (movement-relay backs off and Kafka holds the backlog) instead of being OOMKilled. Empty or null leaves it unbounded. |
| `redis.maxmemoryPolicy` | `noeviction` | Passed as `--maxmemory-policy`. Keep `noeviction`: any evicting policy deletes whole stream keys. |
| `redis.save` | `""` | Passed as `--save`. `""` disables RDB snapshots (AOF covers durability); null keeps the image's built-in schedule. |
| `redis.resources` | `{requests: {cpu: 50m, memory: 1536Mi}, limits: {memory: 2560Mi}}` | Container resource requests/limits, sized for `movementRelay.streamMaxLen` at `redis.maxmemory` plus fork copy-on-write; see values.yaml for the arithmetic. |
| `redis.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `redis.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `redis.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `redis.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `redis.podSecurityContext` | `{runAsUser: 999, runAsGroup: 999}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. Pinned (unlike most other `podSecurityContext` defaults in this chart) because the upstream `redis` image runs as root with no `USER` set at all -- confirmed against `redis:7`'s real image config; 999 is the `redis` user's actual uid/gid per docker-library/redis's own Dockerfile. Override if you point `redis.image` at a different image/tag whose non-root uid differs. |

### enricher

There is intentionally no `replicaCount` and no `enabled` toggle: the
enricher is a singleton consumer of one Redis consumer group plus one sweep
loop, and it renders unconditionally.

`enricher.llm.baseUrl` and `enricher.llm.model` are **required** (alongside
the five `api.sso.*` values) — leaving either empty aborts the render, because both
become non-optional env vars on the binary and an empty value would deploy a
pod that fails every request forever.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enricher.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/enricher` | enricher image repository. |
| `enricher.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `enricher.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `enricher.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `enricher.llm.baseUrl` | `""` | **Required.** Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. Empty aborts the render. |
| `enricher.llm.model` | `""` | **Required.** Model name that endpoint serves. Empty aborts the render. Also stored as the extraction's `model_version`, so changing it re-extracts every incident on the next sweep. |
| `enricher.llm.apiKey` | `""` | API key for that endpoint. Rendered into the chart Secret when `existingSecret` is empty. Empty is valid for a local endpoint needing no auth, and is never auto-generated. |
| `enricher.llm.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the API key from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `enricher.llm.existingSecretApiKeyKey` | `llm-api-key` | Key within `enricher.llm.existingSecret`. |
| `enricher.llmRequestTimeoutSecs` | `300` | Per-request timeout for a single LLM call (`LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`). One incident makes three sequential calls. Behind a gateway that cuts calls itself (e.g. a 504 at ~302 s), set this slightly above the gateway's cutoff (e.g. `320`) so the 504 is what gets reported. |
| `enricher.sweepIntervalSecs` | `3600` | Cadence of the backstop sweep that re-checks every uncleared incident's text hash and model version. |
| `enricher.reclaimIntervalSecs` | `60` | How often the reclaim loop checks for stream entries stuck unacked past `reclaimMinIdleSecs` (a timed-out request, or a crash between processing and acking). |
| `enricher.reclaimMinIdleSecs` | `1000` | How long a pending entry must sit unacked before it's eligible for reclaim, i.e. the retry delay for a failed extraction. Entries whose incident is still being processed are skipped, so this is not a correctness bound; keeping it above `3 * llmRequestTimeoutSecs` avoids needless claim-and-skip passes. |
| `enricher.progressStallSecs` | `1800` | `/livez` stall window (see `workerHealth`): one incident is up to three LLM calls of `llmRequestTimeoutSecs`. |
| `enricher.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `enricher.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. The off-by-default enricher settings below are set here. |
| `enricher.resources` | requests `50m`/`128Mi`, limit `256Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `enricher.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `enricher.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `enricher.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `enricher.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `enricher.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

The enricher has off-by-default settings with no dedicated value. Set them
through `enricher.extraEnv`; with none set, it sends exactly the same
requests as before and never retries a call in-process.

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | unset | Sent as `reasoning_effort` (e.g. `low`). Reasoning models whose default effort is high need it, or they can spend their whole budget thinking and return empty content (`outcome="empty_content"`). |
| `LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | unset | Sent as `max_tokens` (e.g. `8192`). |
| `LLM_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` | unset | Cap on concurrent LLM HTTP requests across the stream, sweep and reclaim loops. |
| `LLM_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES` | `0` | In-call retries on HTTP 429. Each waits `Retry-After` (at least `LLM_RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_SECS`); a `Retry-After` over 600 s fails the call instead. |
| `LLM_RATE_LIMIT_RETRY_SECS` | `20` | Minimum wait before a 429 retry. |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_RETRIES` | `0` | In-call retries on 502/503/504 and client timeouts. Above `0` it also stops a timeout or 504 feeding the per-text retry backoff. (429, 502 and 503 never feed it.) |
| `CARRY_FORWARD_SEMANTIC_NOOPS` | `false` | When `true`, a text change that only touches HTML, whitespace, entities, case or in-word punctuation re-stamps the existing extraction instead of re-running the LLM (`enricher_extraction_carried_forward_total`). With it off, the edit class only labels `enricher_extraction_rerun_total` and `enricher_extraction_churn_total` (`edit_class`). |

For example, for a slow, rate-limited hosted reasoning model:

```yaml
enricher:
  llmRequestTimeoutSecs: 320
  reclaimMinIdleSecs: 3600
  extraEnv:
    - { name: LLM_REASONING_EFFORT, value: "low" }
    - { name: LLM_MAX_TOKENS, value: "8192" }

### trustConsumer

Resolves tracked trains from TRUST train movements. By default it reads
movement-relay's `movement-events` stream; `trustConsumer.kafka.*` is also
the Kafka connection movement-relay falls back to (see `movementRelay`).

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `trustConsumer.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/trust-consumer` | trust-consumer image repository. |
| `trustConsumer.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `trustConsumer.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `trustConsumer.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.brokers` | `""` | RDM Train Movements broker address(es). Used by movement-relay when `movementRelay.kafka.brokers` is empty, and by trust-consumer itself only with `movementFeed: kafka` (then **required**). |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.topic` | `""` | Train Movements topic (production: `TRAIN_MVT_ALL_TOC`). Same fallback and requirement as `brokers`. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.consumerGroup` | `distant-signal-trust-consumer` | Kafka consumer group. For RDM this must be the RDM-issued `SC-...` id; RDM issues one per account, and movement-relay holds it. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.saslMechanism` | `""` | SASL mechanism (production: `PLAIN`). Same fallback and requirement as `brokers`. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.saslUsername` | `""` | SASL username, rendered into the chart Secret as `kafka-sasl-username`. Never auto-generated. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.saslPassword` | `""` | SASL password, rendered as `kafka-sasl-password`. Never auto-generated. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the SASL credential from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.existingSecretUsernameKey` | `kafka-sasl-username` | Key for the SASL username. |
| `trustConsumer.kafka.existingSecretPasswordKey` | `kafka-sasl-password` | Key for the SASL password. |
| `trustConsumer.existingSecret` | `""` | Read this service's internal OAuth2 credential from a pre-existing Secret instead of the chart-rendered one. |
| `trustConsumer.internalOauthUsername` | `""` | Internal OAuth2 service-account username (Authentik `svc-trust-consumer`). |
| `trustConsumer.internalOauthPassword` | `""` | Internal OAuth2 service-account app password. |
| `trustConsumer.existingSecretInternalOauthUsernameKey` | `internal-oauth-username-trust-consumer` | Key for the OAuth2 username in `trustConsumer.existingSecret`. |
| `trustConsumer.existingSecretInternalOauthPasswordKey` | `internal-oauth-password-trust-consumer` | Key for the OAuth2 password in `trustConsumer.existingSecret`. |
| `trustConsumer.referenceReloadSecs` | `60` | How often the active-tracked-trains reference set is reloaded from api. |
| `trustConsumer.stanoxCrsReloadSecs` | `3600` | How often the live STANOX-to-CRS table is reloaded from api's `/private/stanox-crs`. |
| `trustConsumer.retentionDays` | `90` | Days `train_movement_events` rows are kept before pruning. |
| `trustConsumer.healthPort` | `8081` | Port for `/healthz` (readiness) and `/livez` (liveness). |
| `trustConsumer.progressStallSecs` | `300` | `/livez` answers 503 once no consume-loop iteration has completed for this many seconds. |
| `trustConsumer.replicaCount` | `1` | Replicas. Exists so trust-consumer can be scaled to 0 through `helm upgrade`. |
| `trustConsumer.movementFeed` | `redis-stream` | `redis-stream` reads movement-relay's stream. `kafka` is the legacy direct connection (no dead-letter stream, no gap check, and it needs its own consumer group). |
| `trustConsumer.redisAutoclaimMinIdleSecs` | `30` | How long an entry may sit unacknowledged in this consumer's pending list before the periodic sweep reclaims it. |
| `trustConsumer.redisGapCheckSecs` | `60` | How often the consumer group's position is compared with the stream's oldest entry to detect a gap (`redis-stream` only). |
| `trustConsumer.metricsPort` | `9095` | Prometheus `/metrics` port. |
| `trustConsumer.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `trustConsumer.trustTimestampCorrectionEnabled` | `true` | Kill switch for the TRUST timestamp Europe/London-mislabelling correction (`crates/common/src/trust_timestamp.rs`). |
| `trustConsumer.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `trustConsumer.resources` | requests `200m`/`256Mi`, limit `384Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `trustConsumer.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `trustConsumer.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `trustConsumer.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `trustConsumer.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `trustConsumer.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### fullCoverageConsumer

Computes whole-network delay and cancellation stats per line from the
movement stream and the CIF schedule population. It reuses
`trustConsumer.kafka.*` (except the consumer group) when `movementFeed` is
`kafka`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `fullCoverageConsumer.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/full-coverage-consumer` | full-coverage-consumer image repository. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.kafka.consumerGroup` | `distant-signal-full-coverage-consumer` | Kafka consumer group, used only with `movementFeed: kafka`. |

| `fullCoverageConsumer.existingSecretInternalOauthPasswordKey` | `internal-oauth-password-full-coverage-consumer` | Key for the OAuth2 password in `fullCoverageConsumer.existingSecret`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.shadowLines` | `*` | Comma-separated line ids to compute, or `*` for every catalogued line with at least one TIPLOC. Does not decide whether the stats are shown; that is `api`/`aggregator.fullCoverageEnabledDefault` and each line's `full_coverage_enabled`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.populationReloadSecs` | `300` | How often the per-line schedule population is reloaded from api. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.stanoxCrsReloadSecs` | `3600` | How often the STANOX-to-CRS table is reloaded from api. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.statsWriteIntervalSecs` | `60` | How often computed stats are posted to api. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.healthPort` | `8082` | Port for `/healthz` (readiness) and `/livez` (liveness). |

| `fullCoverageConsumer.movementFeed` | `redis-stream` | See `trustConsumer.movementFeed`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.redisAutoclaimMinIdleSecs` | `30` | See `trustConsumer.redisAutoclaimMinIdleSecs`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.redisGapCheckSecs` | `60` | See `trustConsumer.redisGapCheckSecs`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.enabled` | `false` | Windowed full-coverage stats (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-full-coverage-windowed-stats-design.md`). Off: only the whole-day rows are written. Turn on only after api and schedule-reference support it; `aggregator.fullCoverageWindow.mode` is a separate switch. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.recentWindowMinutes` | `60` | The `recent` window covers trains due in the last this-many minutes. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.graceMinutes` | `10` | Windows end this many minutes ago (feed lag p99 plus the write cadence). |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.activationsMin` | `20` | Fewer Activations than this in the last hour marks the write `feed_stale`, so its windows cannot affect severity. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.feedStaleSecs` | `300` | A newest consumed movement older than this also marks the write `feed_stale`. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `fullCoverageConsumer.resources` | requests `200m`/`512Mi`, limit `1Gi` | Container resource requests/limits. Holds per-line population caches, so it scales with the line catalogue. |

| `fullCoverageConsumer.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### trustBacklogConsumer

Keeps a short backlog of TRUST events at key journey points on catalogued
lines, so a train pinned after it has already departed can still be matched.
Always reads movement-relay's stream (there is no Kafka mode).

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `trustBacklogConsumer.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/trust-backlog-consumer` | trust-backlog-consumer image repository. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |

| `trustBacklogConsumer.redisAutoclaimMinIdleSecs` | `30` | See `trustConsumer.redisAutoclaimMinIdleSecs`. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.redisGapCheckSecs` | `60` | See `trustConsumer.redisGapCheckSecs`. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.healthPort` | `8083` | Port for `/healthz` (readiness) and `/livez` (liveness). |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.progressStallSecs` | `300` | `/livez` answers 503 once no consume-loop iteration has completed for this many seconds. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.metricsPort` | `9096` | Prometheus `/metrics` port. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.retentionDaysWarningAcknowledged` | `false` | Documentation-only flag; the binary does not read it. The retention safeguard is `aggregator.trustEventBacklogRetentionDays`. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `trustBacklogConsumer.trustTimestampCorrectionEnabled` | `true` | See `trustConsumer.trustTimestampCorrectionEnabled`. |

| `trustBacklogConsumer.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### movementRelay

The one Kafka client for RDM's Train Movements feed: it copies every
message into the `movement-events` Redis stream the three consumers above
read. On by default. Each empty `movementRelay.kafka.*` connection value
falls back to the matching `trustConsumer.kafka.*` value, and without a
credential of its own it uses trust-consumer's; see "Install" above.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `movementRelay.enabled` | `true` | Deploy movement-relay. Set `false` only for an install that does not ingest TRUST movements. |
| `movementRelay.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/movement-relay` | movement-relay image repository. |
| `movementRelay.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `movementRelay.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `movementRelay.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.brokers` | `""` | Broker address(es). Empty: `trustConsumer.kafka.brokers`. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.topic` | `""` | Train Movements topic. Empty: `trustConsumer.kafka.topic`. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.consumerGroup` | `""` | RDM-issued consumer group id (`SC-...`). Empty: `trustConsumer.kafka.consumerGroup`. The render fails if a consumer on `movementFeed: kafka` would share it. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.saslMechanism` | `""` | SASL mechanism. Empty: `trustConsumer.kafka.saslMechanism`. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.saslUsername` | `""` | movement-relay's own SASL username, rendered into the chart Secret as `movement-relay-kafka-sasl-username`. With this, `saslPassword` and `existingSecret` all empty, trust-consumer's credential is used. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.saslPassword` | `""` | movement-relay's own SASL password (`movement-relay-kafka-sasl-password`). |
| `movementRelay.kafka.existingSecret` | `""` | Read movement-relay's own SASL credential from this pre-existing Secret. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.existingSecretUsernameKey` | `movement-relay-kafka-sasl-username` | Key for movement-relay's own SASL username. |
| `movementRelay.kafka.existingSecretPasswordKey` | `movement-relay-kafka-sasl-password` | Key for movement-relay's own SASL password. |
| `movementRelay.streamLagPollSecs` | `30` | How often consumer-group lag on the stream is polled for the lag gauge. |
| `movementRelay.deadLetterMaxAgeSecs` | `86400` | Dead letters older than this are deleted by movement-relay (`XTRIM MINID`), under the TRUST 1-day retention safeguard. 3600 to 86400; the render fails outside that range. |
| `movementRelay.streamMaxLen` | `1048576` | `MAXLEN ~` cap on the `movement-events` stream, in entries: about 24 hours of traffic and the consumers' only replay window. Move `redis.maxmemory`/`redis.resources` with it (about 100 MiB per 100,000 entries). Minimum 1000. |
| `movementRelay.healthPort` | `8083` | Port for `/healthz` (readiness: partition assignment confirmed) and `/livez` (liveness). |
| `movementRelay.progressStallSecs` | `900` | `/livez` answers 503 once no relay-loop iteration has completed for this many seconds (waiting for Kafka never counts). |
| `movementRelay.metricsPort` | `9094` | Prometheus `/metrics` port. |
| `movementRelay.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value. |
| `movementRelay.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `movementRelay.resources` | requests `100m`/`128Mi`, limit `192Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `movementRelay.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `movementRelay.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `movementRelay.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `movementRelay.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `movementRelay.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

### frontend

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/frontend` | frontend image repository. |
| `frontend.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `frontend.image.digest` | `""` | Exact content digest (`sha256:...`). See `api.image.digest` above. |
| `frontend.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `frontend.replicaCount` | `1` | Safe to raise, with one documented caveat. frontend/lib/liveDataCache.ts keeps a process-local stale-data cache so a backend outage shows the last-known line status instead of an error page (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-frontend-disconnect-reconnect-ux-design.md). That cache is per-pod: with more than one replica, during an outage one visitor may get stale-but-useful content from a warm pod while another gets the auto-retrying error page from a cold one. Each pod stays internally consistent and no stale data crosses users (entries are session-scoped), so this is a degraded-experience caveat, not a correctness one -- deliberately documented rather than blocked, unlike postgresql.replicaCount above. |
| `frontend.service.type` | `ClusterIP` | Service type. |
| `frontend.service.port` | `3000` | Service and container port. |
| `frontend.probes.path` | `/healthz` | Probe path: the dependency-free `frontend/app/healthz/route.ts`, which never calls the api (probing `/` restarted the frontend whenever the api was down). |
| `frontend.probes.readiness.periodSeconds` | `10` | Readiness probe period. |
| `frontend.probes.readiness.failureThreshold` | `3` | Readiness probe failures allowed. |
| `frontend.probes.readiness.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Readiness probe timeout. |
| `frontend.probes.liveness.periodSeconds` | `10` | Liveness probe period. |
| `frontend.probes.liveness.failureThreshold` | `3` | Liveness probe failures allowed. |
| `frontend.probes.liveness.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Liveness probe timeout. |
| `frontend.siteUrl` | `""` | The deployment's public origin (e.g. `https://rail.example.com`), used for share and invite links and same-origin checks. Set it in production. Empty derives it from `ingress.frontend.host` when this chart's ingress publishes the frontend. |
| `frontend.apiBaseUrl` | `""` | Override `API_BASE_URL`. Empty uses the in-cluster api Service. |
| `frontend.legalPagesPublished` | `false` | Publish the DRAFT legal pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/cookies`, `/contact`) and their footer links. Off by default: the text needs the operator's and a lawyer's review, and the operator values in `frontend/lib/legal.ts` must be filled in first. Even when `true`, the pages stay 404 while any placeholder is left in that file. `/attribution` is always public. |
| `frontend.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars appended to the container. |
| `frontend.resources` | requests `100m`/`256Mi`, limit `768Mi` | Container resource requests/limits. |
| `frontend.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pod node selector. |
| `frontend.tolerations` | `[]` | Pod tolerations. |
| `frontend.affinity` | `{}` | Pod affinity rules. |
| `frontend.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `frontend.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |

The frontend is the one workload with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: false`:
`next start` writes its incremental cache under `.next/cache`.

### railMcp

**This chart does not deploy or configure the derived MCP service
("distant-signal-mcp", a fork of train-mcp) itself.** That project has its
own repository, its own CI/tests, and its own Helm chart
(`Distant-Signal-MCP`). Deploy it as its **own, separate Helm release**, then
set the values below. `railMcp` now only configures the frontend's **in-app
chat** (`/chat`) link to that service, plus the connector URL
(`<publicUrl>/mcp`) shown on the `/connect-claude` instructions page and in
`/chat`'s "use it in your own assistant" section. Only the browser talks to the MCP
service (the `/chat` MCP client, its `/chat/callback` OAuth exchange, and the
CSP `connect-src` entry that allows both); the frontend pod makes no
server-to-server call to it.

The MCP service handles its own login as an Authentik OIDC client, so the
old DS consent bridge (`/connect-claude/authorize`) and its values
(`railMcp.baseUrl`, `railMcp.internalCompleteToken`,
`railMcp.existingSecret`, `railMcp.existingSecretInternalCompleteTokenKey`)
were removed on 2026-09-29. The chart has no values schema, so leftover
copies of those keys in an existing values file are ignored; delete them at
your convenience. Everything below is optional and off by default: leaving
`railMcp.enabled` at `false` renders no railMcp env vars at all.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `railMcp.enabled` | `false` | Point the frontend's in-app chat (and the `/connect-claude` instructions page) at a separately, externally-deployed instance of the derived MCP service. |
| `railMcp.publicUrl` | `""` | The other release's own `PUBLIC_URL`, surfaced to the browser as `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAILMCP_PUBLIC_URL` (read at request time). `/chat` connects to `<publicUrl>/mcp` and the CSP `connect-src` allows its origin. Must match what that release was configured with. Blank: `/chat` reports that chat is not configured. |

### pollers

Keys below exist under each of `pollers.incidents`, `pollers.stations`,
`pollers.tocs`, `pollers.ldbws` and `pollers.tfl`; the tfl-only and
ldbws-only rows are marked. The three island-of-Ireland pollers are
separate top-level values (`pollerIrishRailGtfs`, `pollerIrishRailLive`,
`pollerNirStations`), documented in `values.yaml`.

| `pollers.<name>.apiKey` | `""` | RDM API key (tfl: TfL subscription key). Rendered into the chart Secret when `existingSecret` is empty. |
| `pollers.<name>.existingSecret` | `""` | Read the API key AND the internal-oauth username/password below from this pre-existing Secret instead. |
| `pollers.<name>.existingSecretApiKeyKey` | `rdm-<name>-api-key` | Key within `pollers.<name>.existingSecret`. |
| `pollers.<name>.internalOauthUsername` | `""` | This poller's own Authentik service-account username. Never auto-generated. |
| `pollers.<name>.internalOauthPassword` | `""` | This poller's own Authentik app-password. Never auto-generated. |

| `pollers.<name>.podSecurityContext` | `{}` | Merged over the chart-wide pod securityContext defaults. |
| `pollers.tfl.apiKeyEnvVar` | `TFL_APP_KEY` | tfl only: env var the key is passed in (the RDM pollers default to `RDM_API_KEY`). Do not change. |
| `pollers.tfl.dlrPilotEnabled` | `false` | tfl only: DLR arrivals-diffing pilot (`DLR_PILOT_ENABLED`). |
| `pollers.tfl.dlrPilotStopPointId` | `940GZZDLPOP` | tfl only: the DLR pilot's stop point (`DLR_PILOT_STOP_POINT_ID`). |
| `pollers.ldbws.sampleStationsPath` | `/private/sample-stations` | ldbws only: second api endpoint listing which stations to sample. |
| `pollers.ldbws.numRows` | `10` | ldbws only: LDBWS `numRows` query parameter. |
| `pollers.ldbws.hourlyRequestBudget` | `0` | ldbws only (LEG-18): max LDBWS requests per rolling hour, spread evenly over cycles; skipped stations count in `ldbws_budget_skipped_polls_total`. `0` = no budget, env not rendered. |

| `pollers.ldbws.sampleMaxStations` | `0` | ldbws only (LEG-18): cap on sample stations, chosen line-fairly by api, most-pinned lines first. `0` = no cap. |

### pollerIrishRailGtfs

Irish Rail GTFS zip. Off by default; no API key needed.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pollerIrishRailGtfs.enabled` | `false` | Deploy the poller. |

### scheduleFeed

The schedulefeed pod: an SFTP server (SFTPGo) that receives the pushed CIF
timetable, `schedule-ingest` (waits for a complete delivery and posts it
to api) and `schedule-reference` (derives the schedule products from it).
Off by default.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `scheduleFeed.enabled` | `false` | Deploy the schedulefeed pod, Service and PVC. |
| `scheduleFeed.sftp.image.repository` | `drakkan/sftpgo` | SFTP server image. |
| `scheduleFeed.sftp.image.tag` | `v2.7.5@sha256:…` | Must be a real `drakkan/sftpgo` tag: an empty tag would fall back to this chart's version. |

| `scheduleFeed.sftp.username` | `dtd-push` | The push account's username on this server. |
| `scheduleFeed.sftp.authMethod` | `""` | `password` or `public-key`. No default: enabling without it fails the render. |

| `scheduleFeed.service.type` | `LoadBalancer` | `LoadBalancer`, or `NodePort` behind an external load balancer. Not an Ingress: SFTP is not HTTP. |
| `scheduleFeed.service.annotations` | `{}` | Service annotations. |

| `scheduleFeed.persistence.existingClaim` | `""` | Use this existing PVC instead of creating one. |
| `scheduleFeed.logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` value for both Rust containers. |

| `scheduleFeed.podAnnotations` | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `scheduleFeed.podSecurityContext` | `{fsGroup: 1000}` | `fsGroup: 1000` is required: the SFTPGo image runs as UID 1000 and does not chown a fresh volume. |

### workerHealth

Shared `/livez` and `/healthz` settings for the single-container workers
(aggregator, enricher, notifier, every poller including the island-of-Ireland ones, and schedule-ingest). Each
worker's own `progressStallSecs` sets how long its loop may go without
progress before `/livez` fails.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `workerHealth.port` | `8090` | Port the workers serve `/livez` and `/healthz` on. |
| `workerHealth.liveness.initialDelaySeconds` | `30` | Liveness probe initial delay. |
| `workerHealth.liveness.periodSeconds` | `30` | Liveness probe period. |
| `workerHealth.liveness.timeoutSeconds` | `5` | Liveness probe timeout. |
| `workerHealth.liveness.failureThreshold` | `6` | Liveness failures allowed (6 x 30s = 3 minutes on top of the stall window). |
| `workerHealth.readiness.periodSeconds` | `10` | Readiness probe period. |
| `workerHealth.readiness.timeoutSeconds` | `3` | Readiness probe timeout. |
| `workerHealth.readiness.failureThreshold` | `3` | Readiness failures allowed. |
| `workerHealth.pollerProgressStallSecs` | `1800` | Stall window for every poller under `pollers`: one fetch plus up to 15 minutes of ingest retries. |

### ingress

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ingress.enabled` | `false` | Render the Ingress object. |
| `ingress.className` | `""` | IngressClass name. Empty uses the cluster default. |
| `ingress.annotations` | `{}` | Annotations on the Ingress, e.g. `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer`. |
| `ingress.frontend.enabled` | `true` | Publish the frontend host (only when `ingress.enabled`). |
| `ingress.frontend.host` | `""` | Hostname for the web UI. Required when enabled. |
| `ingress.api.enabled` | `false` | Publish the api host. **Also exposes `/private/*`.** |
| `ingress.api.host` | `""` | Hostname for the api. Required when enabled. |
| `ingress.tls` | `[]` | TLS blocks passed through verbatim. |

### metrics

On by default: the exporters are in-process and add no runtime dependency
once the images are built. `metrics.enabled: false` is a real off switch,
not merely an un-scraped one — it renders `METRICS_ENABLED=false` into every
workload, and each binary then never starts its `/metrics` listener at all
(api keeps its own public HTTP listener, but drops the request-metrics
middleware and never starts the internal `/metrics` listener below). Every
Rust workload, api included, serves `/metrics` on a listener separate from its
own public/service port: `metrics.port` for most, and a component-specific
port for the three consumers, movement-relay, the island-of-Ireland pollers
and schedulefeed's reference container (`<component>.metricsPort`,
`scheduleFeed.reference.metricsPort`). Until 2026-09-25 api was the
one exception (it served `/metrics` on `api.service.port` itself, which
made it internet-reachable through the api Ingress whenever
`ingress.api.enabled` was also set — a Signal Box Audit Low finding); it
now matches every other workload.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `metrics.enabled` | `true` | Expose Prometheus `/metrics` on every workload, and render the metrics port, env, `prometheus.io/*` scrape annotations and NetworkPolicy allows. |
| `metrics.port` | `9091` | Port api, the aggregator, the enricher, the notifier, the `pollers.*` and schedule-ingest serve `/metrics` on — a listener separate from api's own public/service port. The workloads listed above use their own `metricsPort` values. |
| `metrics.podMonitor.enabled` | `false` | Render a Prometheus Operator `PodMonitor`. Off by default — the CRD is absent on clusters without the operator, and installing it would fail the release outright. |
| `metrics.podMonitor.interval` | `30s` | Scrape interval on the `PodMonitor`. |
| `metrics.podMonitor.scrapeTimeout` | `10s` | Scrape timeout on the `PodMonitor`. Must stay below `interval`. |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.enabled` | `false` | Render a Prometheus Operator `PrometheusRule` with the alerts below. Off by default for the same CRD reason as the `PodMonitor`; also needs `metrics.enabled`. |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.labels` | `{}` | Extra labels on the `PrometheusRule` object — whatever your Prometheus's `ruleSelector` matches (e.g. `release: kube-prometheus-stack`). |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.annotations` | `{}` | Extra annotations on the `PrometheusRule` object. |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.ruleLabels` | `{}` | Extra labels added to every alert, next to `severity`. |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.runbookBaseUrl` | GitHub `main` | Prefix for each alert's `runbook_url`; the repo-relative doc path is appended. |
| `metrics.prometheusRule.<alert>` | see `values.yaml` | Per-alert `enabled`, `for`, `severity` and threshold settings, `for` durations, severities and thresholds for `movementLag`, `movementLagGrowing`, `streamGap`, `deadLetter`, `deadLetterFull`, `relayPublishFailing`, `redisPersistence`, `groupRecreated`, `deadLetterExpiring`, `enricherErrors`, `componentMemory`, `fullCoverageWindow`, `notifierPushDropped`, `userSignupSpike`, `archiveUploadFailures`, `archiveExpiry`, `schedulePipeline`, `pollerFailures`, `ldbwsStalestStation` and `ldbwsInvalidCrs`. |

#### Alerts

Every alert is named `DistantSignal*` and covers only what this chart's own
metrics can tell (plus per-container memory headroom). Generic signals —
OOMKilled, restart spikes, pods not ready — belong to the cluster's own
rules and are deliberately not duplicated here. The reverse also holds: this
chart is the source for every `DistantSignal*` alert below, so a cluster's
own rules should not define an alert with the same name (two copies fire
twice). Every
expression is scoped to `namespace="<release namespace>"`, the label the
`PodMonitor` attaches, so the rules only see series scraped that way (or by
an equivalent scrape that sets `namespace`). The `movement-events` group is
rendered only when `movementRelay.enabled` is true, the full-coverage-window
group only when `fullCoverageConsumer.windowedStats.enabled`, the archive
alert only when `archive.enabled`, the archive-expiry group only when
`archive.expiry.enabled` too, and the schedule-pipeline group only when
`scheduleFeed.enabled`.

| Alert | Severity | Fires when (defaults) |
|---|---|---|
| `DistantSignalMovementLagHigh` | warning | A consumer group's `movement_relay_stream_lag` plus `movement_relay_stream_pending` (delivered but un-ACKed: a consumer whose downstream fails keeps reading, so its backlog sits in pending) is above 25% of the stream cap (`movement_relay_stream_maxlen`, falling back to `movementRelay.streamMaxLen`) for 10m. |
| `DistantSignalMovementLagCritical` | critical | The same, above 50%. |
| `DistantSignalMovementLagGrowing` | warning | A group's lag has a positive `deriv` and grew by more than 5000 entries over 30m, for 10m. Lag never reads 0, so neither alert is on `> 0`. |
| `DistantSignalStreamGap` | warning | trust-consumer, full-coverage-consumer or trust-backlog-consumer counted a stream gap (`*_stream_gap_detected_total`) within the last 1h. |
| `DistantSignalDeadLetterGrowing` | warning | Any record dead-lettered (`movement_feed_deadlettered_total`) within the last 1h. |
| `DistantSignalDeadLetterNearFull` | warning | The dead-letter stream's length (`movement_relay_deadletter_length`, read by movement-relay every tick; falls back to the consumers' `movement_feed_deadletter_length`) above 80% of the 10,000-record cap. |
| `DistantSignalDeadLetterFull` | critical | A dead-letter write was refused because the stream is full (`movement_feed_deadletter_full_total`) within the last 1h. |
| `DistantSignalDeadLetterExpiring` | warning | The oldest dead letter (`movement_relay_deadletter_oldest_age_seconds`) is within 4h (`deadLetterExpiring.warnBeforeTrimSecs`) of `movementRelay.deadLetterMaxAgeSecs` (24h), after which movement-relay deletes it, for 5m. Re-inject it first. |
| `DistantSignalMovementRelayPublishFailing` | critical | movement-relay failed every `XADD` (`movement_relay_errors_total{operation=~"publish_event\|redis_oom"}`) and published nothing over 10m, for 5m: Redis is refusing writes and TRUST ingestion has stopped. |
| `DistantSignalRedisPersistenceFailing` | critical | Redis's last AOF write or rewrite failed (`redis_aof_last_write_ok` / `redis_aof_last_bgrewrite_ok` is 0, from movement-relay's `INFO persistence`), or, for the bundled Redis with persistence, AOF is off, for 5m. |
| `DistantSignalMovementGroupRecreated` | warning | Within 1h a consumer recreated its group after `NOGROUP` (`movement_feed_group_recreated_total`), or movement-relay recreated a missing stream with every group (`movement_relay_stream_created_total`): Redis lost its data. |
| `DistantSignalEnricherErrors` | warning | Over 30m, more than 50% of an LLM call site's calls (`enricher_llm_call_total{outcome!="success"}`: `error`, `timeout`, `rate_limited`, `gateway_error`, `http_error` or `empty_content`) failed, with at least 3 failures, for 15m. |
| `DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowFeedStale` | warning | full-coverage-consumer has marked its windows `feed_stale` (`full_coverage_consumer_window_feed_stale` is 1) for 15m. |
| `DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowPostErrors` | warning | A POST to `/private/full-coverage-window-stats` failed (`full_coverage_consumer_errors_total{operation="post_window_stats"}`) within the last 30m. |
| `DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowStatsStalled` | warning | No window rows posted (`full_coverage_consumer_window_rows_posted_total`) over 10m, for 15m. |
| `DistantSignalComponentMemoryHigh` | warning | A container in this release's pods (`pod=~"<fullname>-.*"`) has a working set (cadvisor) above 80% of its memory limit (kube-state-metrics) for 10m. |
| `DistantSignalNotifierPushDropped` | warning | The notifier dropped at least 5 decided pushes (`notifier_push_dropped_total{reason}`) within the last 1h. Delivery is at-most-once. |
| `DistantSignalUserSignupSpike` | warning | api created more than 20 user accounts (`userSignupSpike.metric`, default `distant_signal_api_users_created_total`) within the last 1h. Sign-up is open to any account the IdP admits (in production, any Discord account), so a burst is real growth or scripted sign-ups. Check the newest `users` rows and the IdP's enrolment log; to stop it, restrict enrolment in the IdP, then revoke the unwanted sessions ([session revocation](../../docs/session-revocation.md)). Needs an api build that exports the counter; silent until then. |
| `DistantSignalArchiveUploadFailures` | warning | At least 3 cold-archive batch uploads or verifications failed (`aggregator_archive_upload_failures_total`) within the last 1h. |
| `DistantSignalArchiveExpiryErrors` | warning | Any cold-archive expiry error (`aggregator_archive_expiry_errors_total{stage}`: a failed LIST or DELETE, or a key refused by the pre-delete check) within the last 1d. |
| `DistantSignalArchiveExpiryUnmatchedKeys` | warning | Expiry listed keys under an archive table prefix that do not match the archive layout (`aggregator_archive_expiry_skipped_unmatched_total{table}`) within the last 1d. They are never deleted. |
| `DistantSignalArchiveExpiryCapReached` | warning | An expiry run hit `archive.expiry.maxDeletesPerRun` (`aggregator_archive_expiry_cap_reached_total`) within the last 1d. |
| `DistantSignalArchiveExpiryOverdue` | warning | The oldest archived `service_date` (`aggregator_archive_oldest_service_date_seconds{table}`) is older than `archive.expiry.retentionDays` + 7 days, for 1h: expiry is not running, is failing, or is still in dry-run. |
| `DistantSignalScheduleReferenceNotSeeded` | warning | schedule-reference has not read its last completed publish from api (`schedule_reference_seeded` is 0) for 30m. |
| `DistantSignalScheduleFeedZipRejected` | warning | schedule-ingest quarantined a delivery zip (`schedule_feed_zip_rejected_total`) within the last 6h. |
| `DistantSignalCorpusRejected` | warning | schedule-ingest refused a CORPUS extract (`schedule_feed_corpus_rejected_total`) within the last 6h. The series exists only while `scheduleFeed.corpus.enabled`. |
| `DistantSignalCorpusStale` | warning | The newest loaded CORPUS delivery (`api_corpus_last_delivered_at_seconds`, set by api from `corpus_deliveries` at startup and after each load) is over 45 days old (`schedulePipeline.corpusStaleAfterDays`), for 1h. CORPUS is published monthly: 45 days is one cycle plus two weeks' grace. Rendered only when `scheduleFeed.corpus.enabled`, and silent before the first load. |
| `DistantSignalScheduleReferencePublishStale` | warning | No CIF delivery fully published for over 30h (`schedule_reference_last_published_delivery_timestamp_seconds`), for 15m. |
| `DistantSignalSchedulePublishStagedMismatch` | warning | api skipped a final chunk's delete because the staged key count did not match (`api_schedule_publish_staged_mismatch_total{product}`) within the last 6h. |
| `DistantSignalScheduleReferencePublishRejected` | warning | api answered 400/413/422 to a schedule-reference product (`schedule_reference_publishes_total{outcome="rejected"}`) within the last 6h. |
| `DistantSignalLinePopulationMissing` | warning | After 06:00 London, some line still has no schedule population for today (`full_coverage_consumer_population_missing_past_deadline_lines` above 0) for 15m. |
| `DistantSignalPollerFailing` | warning | A poller completed no successful cycle and at least one failed one (`poller_cycle_total{result}`) over the last 2h, or more than half its cycles over the last 1h failed (`pollerFailures.failureRatio`, `ratioWindow`) (SVC-08). Rendered only when a poller (including an island-of-Ireland one) is enabled, in a separate `<fullname>-pollers` PrometheusRule. |
| `DistantSignalLdbwsStationStale` | warning | The least recently sampled LDBWS station (`ldbws_stalest_station_age_seconds`) is over 7200s old for 30m: the rotation stopped reaching part of the list (SVC-04). Stations LDBWS rejects as an invalid CRS are excluded. Only when `pollers.ldbws.enabled`. |
| `DistantSignalLdbwsInvalidCrs` | warning | LDBWS has answered "Invalid crs code supplied" for a sample station (`ldbws_invalid_crs_station{crs}` is 1) for 15m: a `lines/*.toml` typo. The poller re-probes it hourly instead of every cycle. Only when `pollers.ldbws.enabled`. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestCheckFailed` | critical | The daily pgBackRest check Job or the weekly verify Job failed within 26h: archiving is broken, `verify` found a bad file, or WAL is missing (a PITR gap). This group renders only with `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled`, in a separate `<fullname>-pgbackrest` PrometheusRule (`metrics.prometheusRule.pgbackrest`), and reads kube-state-metrics and postgres_exporter series rather than this chart's own. Runbook: `docs/postgres-pitr.md`. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupFailed` | warning | A full or diff backup Job failed within 26h. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupStale` | warning | No full or diff backup CronJob success (`kube_cronjob_status_last_successful_time`) for 30h, for 10m. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestFullBackupStale` | warning | No full backup success for 8d, for 10m. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveFailing` | warning | postgres_exporter's `pg_stat_archiver_failed_count` rose over 15m, for 10m. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveStalled` | warning | `pg_stat_archiver_archived_count` didn't rise over 15m, for 10m (`archive_timeout` switches segments every minute while anything writes). |

Metric names above omit the `distant_signal_` prefix every app metric
carries. The dead-letter and stream-gap counters are registered at 0 when
each process starts, so those alerts use a plain `increase()`. They no
longer also fire on a series that is new within the window: every rollout
creates new per-pod series, so that clause fired on every rollout.

### networkPolicy

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `networkPolicy.enabled` | `false` | Render default-deny NetworkPolicies with explicit allows. |
| `networkPolicy.ingressControllerNamespace` | `ingress-nginx` | Namespace the ingress controller runs in, matched by `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`. |
| `networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressNamespaces` | `[]` | Extra namespaces allowed to reach `api.service.port` (e.g. `[ds-mcp]` for the Distant-Signal-MCP). |
| `networkPolicy.apiExtraIngressPodLabels` | `ds-mcp`: `app.kubernetes.io/name: distant-signal-mcp`, `app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp` | Per-namespace pod labels that narrow an `apiExtraIngressNamespaces` entry to the calling pods. A namespace with no entry admits all its pods. Set an entry to `null` to clear it; `{}` merges with the default and does not clear it. |
| `networkPolicy.tunnel.enabled` | `false` | Admit an in-cluster tunnel connector (e.g. cloudflared) to the frontend. See [NetworkPolicy](#networkpolicy). |
| `networkPolicy.tunnel.namespace` | `cloudflared` | Namespace the connector runs in, matched by `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`. |
| `networkPolicy.tunnel.podLabels` | `app.kubernetes.io/name: cloudflared` | Labels selecting the connector pods. Empty admits the whole namespace. |
| `networkPolicy.tunnel.api` | `false` | Also admit the connector to `api.service.port`, for a hostname routed straight to the api. Requires `api.rateLimit.trustXRealIp: false`. |
| `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace` | `monitoring` | Namespace Prometheus runs in, matched by `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`. Allowed to reach each workload's metrics port. Only used when `metrics.enabled` is true. |
| `networkPolicy.egress.enabled` | `false` | Render an egress policy for every component (see [NetworkPolicy](#networkpolicy)). |
| `networkPolicy.egress.privateCidrs` | RFC 1918, CGNAT, loopback, link-local, reserved | IPv4 ranges excluded from the public-internet egress allow. |
| `networkPolicy.egress.privateCidrsV6` | loopback, ULA, link-local, multicast, NAT64/6to4/Teredo | IPv6 ranges excluded from the public-internet egress allow. |
| `networkPolicy.egress.extraDeniedCidrs` | `[]` | More CIDRs (IPv4 and IPv6 mixed) excluded from the public-internet egress allow, on top of `privateCidrs`/`privateCidrsV6`. Set the nodes' own public addresses here. |
| `networkPolicy.egress.extraRules` | `[]` | Extra NetworkPolicyEgressRule entries appended to every egress policy the chart renders. |
| `networkPolicy.components` | `{}` | Per-component settings keyed by the `app.kubernetes.io/component` label (`api`, `postgres`, `poller-ldbws`, ...); an unknown key fails the render. Each entry: `egress` (`false` renders no egress policy for it), `internet` (add or drop its public-internet rule). See [NetworkPolicy](#networkpolicy). |
| `scheduleFeed.sftp.allowedCidrs` | `[]` | Source CIDRs allowed to reach SFTP when `networkPolicy.enabled`. Empty allows any source. |

### scheduleFeed: CIF routing and CORPUS

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-corpus-sftp-ingest-design.md`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `scheduleFeed.ingest.cifFilePattern` | `timetable_full.zip` | Case-insensitive `*` globs (comma-separated) naming CIF deliveries in the landing folder. Locked to DTD's exact delivery name. |
| `scheduleFeed.ingest.cifExcludePattern` | `CORPUSExtract*` | Globs that are never CIF deliveries, so a CORPUS or SMART file pushed as a zip is never published as the timetable. |
| `scheduleFeed.corpus.enabled` | `false` | Load Network Rail CORPUS (`CORPUSExtract.json.gz`, pushed to the same SFTP account and folder) into `corpus_locations`. Off: the file stays in the landing folder with a one-time stray warning. |
| `scheduleFeed.corpus.filePattern` | `CORPUSExtract.json.gz` | Globs naming the CORPUS extract. `CORPUSExtract.csv.gz` (SMART berth data) is deliberately ignored. |
| `scheduleFeed.corpus.minRows` | `10000` | Fewer rows than this rejects the extract instead of replacing the table. |
| `scheduleFeed.corpus.maxDecompressedBytes` | `268435456` | gzip-bomb guard. |
| `scheduleFeed.corpus.retentionKeep` | `3` | Processed (and, separately, rejected) extracts kept under `/data/schedule-feed/corpus/`. |

### tests

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tests.enabled` | `true` | Render the `helm test` hook Pod. |
| `tests.image.repository` | `""` | Empty reuses the api image, which already ships `curl`. |
| `tests.image.tag` | `""` | Empty means "use the chart's appVersion". |
| `tests.image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |

## Testing

```bash
helm test distant-signal -n distant-signal
```

The hook Pod runs `curl -fsS --max-time 10 http://<release>-api:8080/public/health`
against the in-cluster api Service; `-f` makes curl exit non-zero on any HTTP
error status, which is what `helm test` reads as failure. Running it requires
a **live cluster with the images available** — it is an operator step, not
part of chart authoring.

## Uninstall

```bash
helm uninstall distant-signal -n distant-signal
```

> **The PVC created by `volumeClaimTemplates` survives uninstall.** Helm does
> not delete StatefulSet volume claims, which is deliberate — it is what
> stops an accidental `helm uninstall` from destroying the database. If you
> do not want the data, delete it manually:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl delete pvc -n distant-signal -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=distant-signal
> ```

## Not in scope

- **No image build or publish pipeline in this chart itself.** The repo-level
  `.github/workflows/containers.yml` covers that (see "Building and pushing
  the images (manual)" above for the fallback path and the full
  Dockerfile-to-repository mapping it uses).
- **No HorizontalPodAutoscaler.** The aggregator, the enricher and every
  poller are singleton loops that must not be scaled, and the api is
  database-bound.
- **No backup or HA for the bundled Redis.** It is a single replica with
  AOF persistence on a PVC; see "Using an external Redis" above.
- **No backup, restore or replication** for the bundled Postgres. It is a
  single-replica StatefulSet on a PVC. Set `postgresql.enabled: false` and
  use a managed database if you need HA.
- **No ServiceMonitor, no bundled Prometheus and no dashboards.** Every
  service does expose a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (see the `metrics`
  values below), and the chart can render a `PodMonitor` for Prometheus
  Operator, but it never installs Prometheus itself, ships no Grafana
  dashboards, only Distant-Signal-specific alerting rules (an opt-in
  `PrometheusRule`, see `metrics.prometheusRule` below; generic pod/cluster
  alerts are left to the cluster), and offers no `ServiceMonitor`
  alternative — `PodMonitor` alone, because the pollers, the aggregator and
  the enricher have no Service in front of them at all.
