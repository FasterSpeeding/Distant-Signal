# Provisions the SFTP-login account DTD's push client authenticates as,
# then execs `sftpgo serve`. The one copy of this script: the chart's
# schedulefeed-configmap.yaml embeds it with .Files.Get, and
# docker-compose.yml's `schedule-sftp` service bind-mounts it.
#
# Environment:
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_USERNAME      the account (required)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_HOME_DIR      its home_dir, which is also its SFTP chroot
#                               root (required)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_PUBLIC_KEY    authenticate by this public key, or else
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_PASSWORD      by this password (one of the two required)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_LOADDATA_DIR  where the loaddata JSON is written
#                               (default /run/sftp-bootstrap)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_PERMISSIONS   comma-separated SFTPGo permissions on "/"
#                               (default upload,overwrite,list)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_MAX_SESSIONS  simultaneous sessions for the account
#                               (default 2; 0 = unlimited)
#   SCHEDULE_SFTP_MAX_UPLOAD_FILE_SIZE  largest single upload, in bytes
#                               (default 0 = unlimited)
#
# Least privilege (2026-10-01): the account can only write files into its
# home directory. docs/schedule-feed-sftp.md has the evidence behind each
# permission (what DTD's JSch 0.1.54 client was seen to do).
#
# SFTPGO_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME/PASSWORD (this repo's earlier approach, now
# removed) never worked for this: confirmed directly against SFTPGo's own
# Go source (github.com/drakkan/sftpgo, internal/dataprovider/admin.go's
# Admin.setFromEnv(), called only from dataprovider.go's checkDefaultAdmin())
# that those env vars bootstrap SFTPGo's web-UI/REST-API *admin* account
# (dataprovider.Admin, PermAdminAny) -- a completely separate entity from an
# SFTP-login *user* (dataprovider.User). Setting them never created the
# account DTD (or this service's own paramiko-based test) tries to log in
# as, which is exactly the "not found: sql: no rows in result set" error
# this task started from.
#
# The real, documented mechanism is SFTPGo's own `--loaddata-from` flag /
# SFTPGO_LOADDATA_FROM env var: it loads a JSON dump (same shape as its
# `dumpdata` REST endpoint produces) of users/folders/admins/etc at startup.
# Confirmed directly against SFTPGo's source (checked against the `main`
# branch):
#   - internal/cmd/root.go wires SFTPGO_LOADDATA_FROM/_MODE/_CLEAN/_SCAN as
#     real, current flags (loaddata-mode defaults to 1: "new users are
#     added, existing users are not modified").
#   - internal/service/service.go's Service.Start() -> startServices() calls
#     Service.LoadInitialData() (which reads/parses/restores this file)
#     BEFORE binding the SFTP/FTP/HTTP listeners -- so the account exists
#     before anything can connect, and this needs no HTTP/API port exposed
#     at all.
#   - internal/httpd/api_maintenance.go's RestoreUsers does a
#     username-keyed upsert: mode 1 leaves a user that already exists
#     untouched, mode 0 (used below since 2026-10-01) updates it to match
#     this file. The SQLite user store lives on the container's writable
#     layer, so in practice every start creates the account afresh ("adding
#     new user" in the log); mode 0 makes that a guarantee, so a permission
#     or password change here can never be silently ignored.
#   - internal/dataprovider/dataprovider.go's createUserPasswordHash (run
#     for every Add/UpdateUser, including the loaddata restore path) hashes
#     any password that isn't already in a recognized hash format -- so the
#     plaintext password below is correct as-is.
#
# SCHEDULE_SFTP_HOME_DIR is set, by the chart and by docker-compose.yml, to
# the same absolute path schedule-ingest watches (WATCH_DIR), so DTD's push
# client -- which sees itself uploading to "/" once connected -- lands files
# exactly where schedule-ingest looks for them. SFTPGo creates home_dir
# itself if it doesn't already exist (vfs/osfs.go's CheckRootPath).
