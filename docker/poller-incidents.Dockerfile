# Multi-stage build for the `poller-incidents` service.
#
# Builder pin: edition 2024 (used by every crate in this workspace) needs
# rustc 1.85+, but this crate's resolved Cargo.lock also pulls in transitive
# deps (icu_* via idna/url, used by reqwest) whose *published* crate version
# requires rustc 1.86+. 1.86 is the actual floor for this lockfile, not 1.85.
#
# Build from the repo root so the workspace's `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` and
# `crates/common` path dependency are all in the build context:
#   docker build -f docker/poller-incidents.Dockerfile .
