"""Generate lines/generated/pass-through.toml from the CIF timetable.

For every catalogue line (lines/*.toml) and every pair of consecutive
`[[stations]]` on it, the stations the line's trains really run through
between the two, calling or passing (a fast train passes them, CIF records
the pass): the Brighton Main Line's London Bridge -> East Croydon leg runs
through New Cross Gate, Brockley, Honor Oak Park, Forest Hill, Sydenham,
Penge West, Anerley and Norwood Junction. The matcher counts them as on the
line for resolving the places an incident names (an incident "between New
Cross Gate and Norwood Junction" is on the Brighton Main Line); they are
never shown as the line's stops. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-incident-line-evidence-design.md.

Source: `schedule_calling_points_full` (every calling and passing point of
every schedule, by service date, as published by schedule-reference) joined
to `schedule_destination_departures` (a train's operator; passenger trains
only) and `tiploc_crs` (TIPLOC -> CRS). Read-only SELECTs. Three
representative days: by default the latest Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday
held in `schedule_calling_points_full` (it keeps a rolling fortnight);
`--date` overrides them.

Per leg (A, B): the paths, A to B or B to A, of the line's own trains (a
train belongs to the lines of its operator whose stations its route reaches
most often: `line_trains`) that call at or pass both, keeping only paths
with no other station of the line in between (so A and B really are
adjacent on the train's route). The most common path, or a fuller record
of the same route (`route_of`), gives the leg's stations, in order from A
to B. Only CRS codes in the `stations` reference table are kept (TIPLOCs
of junctions and depots that carry a CRS are not places an incident names).
A leg none of the line's trains runs (a branch boundary in the catalogue's
station order) gets nothing.

Run it after each timetable change (the December and May principal
changes) and after changing a line's stations, commit the result, and see
lines/SCHEMA.md.

The output is deterministic for the same data: lines sorted by id, legs in
catalogue order. Stdlib only; queries run through `psql` (a URL, or any
command that runs psql, such as `kubectl exec ... -- psql ...`).
