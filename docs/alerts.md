# Alert runbook

One section per `DistantSignal*` alert in the chart's PrometheusRules
(`charts/distant-signal/templates/prometheusrule.yaml` and
`pgbackrest-prometheusrule.yaml`). Each alert's `runbook_url` links to its
section here. The chart README's "Alerts" table lists what each one fires on,
with the default thresholds.

## Why the alerts themselves are terse

On 2026-10-01 ntfy refused notifications for a 3-alert
`DistantSignalPollerFailing` group: Alertmanager's webhook was 5.8 KB of JSON,
and ntfy rejects anything over 4,096 bytes. Most of each alert's ~2 KB was its
`generatorURL` (the URL-encoded PromQL, 953 characters for that rule) and a
multi-sentence description. So every alert now has:

- a one-line `summary` (at most 80 characters) and a `description` (at most
  150), with the explanation here instead;
- an `expr` of at most about 300 characters. A longer expression is a
  recording rule named `distant_signal:<what>:<how>`, placed before the alert
  in the same rule group. Prometheus evaluates a group's rules in order, so
  the alert reads the value recorded in the same evaluation and fires exactly
  as the inline expression did.

`scripts/check-alert-payloads.py` (CI's scripts-lint job) renders the chart
with every alert on and fails when an alert breaks those limits, or when a
3-alert group's estimated webhook JSON is over 4,096 bytes. With
`--download-promtool DIR` it also runs `promtool check rules` and the unit
tests in `scripts/alert-rules-tests/`.

Metric names below omit the `distant_signal_` prefix.

## movement-events

### DistantSignalMovementLagHigh

A consumer group's unread entries (`movement_relay_stream_lag`) plus its
delivered-but-unACKed ones (`movement_relay_stream_pending`) are above
`movementLag.warningRatio` of the stream's MAXLEN cap
(`movement_relay_stream_maxlen`, or `movementRelay.streamMaxLen` before a
relay exports it). Recorded as `distant_signal:movement_events_behind:ratio`.

A consumer whose downstream (api) is failing keeps reading and leaves each
failed batch pending, so its lag stays near 0 while pending grows; MAXLEN trims
pending entries all the same. Once lag plus pending reaches the cap, entries
are trimmed before the group reads them (a stream gap).

1. Read the consumer's logs: is it failing to POST to api, or is it slow?
2. Check api's health.

Design: [movement-relay design](superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-movement-relay-design.md).

### DistantSignalMovementLagCritical

As [DistantSignalMovementLagHigh](#distantsignalmovementlaghigh), above
`movementLag.criticalRatio`. A stream gap (data loss) is close. Fix the
consumer, or raise `movementRelay.streamMaxLen` together with Redis
`maxmemory` to buy time.

### DistantSignalMovementLagGrowing

A group's lag has a positive `deriv` over `movementLagGrowing.window` and
grew by more than `minIncrease` entries net (recorded as
`distant_signal:movement_events_lag:deriv` and `:delta`). Lag never reads 0
(the steady-state baseline is a few hundred entries), so this needs both a
rising trend and a real increase. The group consumes slower than
movement-relay publishes; left alone, lag reaches the cap and entries are
trimmed unread. Look for a slow downstream (api latency, DB load) or a
consumer that is CPU-bound.

### DistantSignalStreamGap

trust-consumer, full-coverage-consumer or trust-backlog-consumer found that
movement-events entries were trimmed before it read them
(`<consumer>_stream_gap_detected_total`, recorded per consumer as
`distant_signal:movement_stream_gaps:increase`). Those TRUST events are lost
to that consumer: treat the rail day's derived data as not clean. It is
usually preceded by `DistantSignalMovementLagCritical`.

### DistantSignalDeadLetterGrowing

A consumer group moved records to `movement-events-deadletter`
(`movement_feed_deadlettered_total{group,reason}`). This should stay at 0.
Inspect the records, then re-inject or delete them:
[movement-events-deadletter](movement-events-deadletter.md).

### DistantSignalDeadLetterNearFull

The dead-letter stream holds more than `deadLetter.nearFullRatio` of its
10,000-record cap (`movement_relay_deadletter_length`, falling back to the
consumers' `movement_feed_deadletter_length`). It is never trimmed by count;
once full, new poison records stay pending in their group instead. Drain it:
[movement-events-deadletter](movement-events-deadletter.md#capacity-never-trimmed-by-count).

### DistantSignalDeadLetterFull

A consumer tried to dead-letter records but the stream is at its cap
(`movement_feed_deadletter_full_total`). Those records stay pending and are
retried forever until the stream is drained:
[movement-events-deadletter](movement-events-deadletter.md#deleting).

### DistantSignalMovementRelayPublishFailing

movement-relay failed every XADD (`movement_relay_errors_total{operation=~"publish_event|redis_oom"}`)
and published nothing over `relayPublishFailing.window`
(`distant_signal:movement_relay_publish_failing:bool` is 1). TRUST ingestion
has stopped, and no lag alert fires because the stream simply stops growing.
The relay's `/livez` stays 200 (a failed cycle is progress), so nothing
restarts it. Kafka holds the backlog only for as long as the topic retains it.

- OOM: Redis is at `maxmemory`.
- `MISCONF` or an AOF error: see
  [DistantSignalRedisPersistenceFailing](#distantsignalredispersistencefailing).
- `NOAUTH`: the Redis password changed.
- Redis down: check its pod.

Design: [Redis message queue evaluation](superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-redis-message-queue-evaluation-design.md).

### DistantSignalRedisPersistenceFailing

From movement-relay's `INFO persistence` gauges
(`distant_signal:redis_aof_health:min` is 0): Redis's last AOF write
(`redis_aof_last_write_ok`) or rewrite (`redis_aof_last_bgrewrite_ok`) failed,
or, for the bundled Redis with `redis.persistence.enabled`, AOF is off
(`redis_aof_enabled`).

- A failed AOF write makes Redis refuse every write, so movement-relay stops
  publishing.
- A failed rewrite lets the AOF grow until the disk fills.
- With AOF off, a restart loses movement-events and every consumer group.

Check `INFO persistence`, the Redis logs and the disk behind `/data`.

### DistantSignalMovementGroupRecreated

A consumer found its group missing (`NOGROUP`) and recreated it
(`movement_feed_group_recreated_total{group}`), or movement-relay found the
stream itself missing and recreated it with every group
(`movement_relay_stream_created_total`, shown as `group="(all)"`); recorded
as `distant_signal:movement_group_recreations:increase`. Redis lost its data
(AOF lost or unreadable, volume replaced) or the group was deleted. Its
pending entries, and after an empty restart every entry it had not read, are
gone, and the stream-gap check cannot see this. Treat that rail day as
partial.

### DistantSignalDeadLetterExpiring

The oldest dead letter (`movement_relay_deadletter_oldest_age_seconds`) is
within `deadLetterExpiring.warnBeforeTrimSecs` of
`movementRelay.deadLetterMaxAgeSecs`, after which movement-relay deletes it
(the TRUST 1-day retention safeguard). Re-inject it, or deliberately discard
it, before then:
[movement-events-deadletter](movement-events-deadletter.md#retention-deleted-after-24-hours).

### DistantSignalMovementFeedLongPending

A group re-read entries already delivered more than 240 times
(`movement_feed_long_pending_total{group}`). They are retried forever and
never dead-lettered: a long downstream outage, or a failure the consumer
cannot classify as a data rejection. See
[long-pending entries](movement-events-deadletter.md#long-pending-entries),
and act before the stream cap trims them.

### DistantSignalTrustEnvelopeParseDrops

A consumer dropped TRUST envelopes whose body did not match the known shape
(`<consumer>_errors_total{operation="parse_envelope",msg_type}`, recorded as
`distant_signal:trust_envelope_parse_drops:increase`). A steady rate for one
`msg_type` means the feed's schema changed, which otherwise looks like trains
no longer moving. See
[envelope parse drops](movement-events-deadletter.md#envelope-parse-drops).

## enricher

### DistantSignalEnricherErrors

More than `enricherErrors.errorRatio` of an LLM call site's calls failed over
the window, with at least `minErrors` failures
(`distant_signal:enricher_llm_call_failures:ratio` and `:increase`, from
`enricher_llm_call_total{outcome!="success"}`). Incidents are not being
enriched. Check the LLM endpoint (`enricher.llm.baseUrl`), its credentials
and rate limits, and enricher's logs.

## full-coverage windows

Design: [windowed full-coverage stats](superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-full-coverage-windowed-stats-design.md).

### DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowFeedStale

full-coverage-consumer has marked its windows `feed_stale`
(`full_coverage_consumer_window_feed_stale`): too few TRUST Activations in the
last hour, or no movement event recently. No window influences severity and
no train is presumed cancelled meanwhile. Expected during a known TRUST
outage; otherwise check movement-relay and the consumer's lag.

### DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowPostErrors

A POST to `/private/full-coverage-window-stats` failed
(`full_coverage_consumer_errors_total{operation="post_window_stats"}`). An api
without that route (not yet deployed, or its migrations not run) answers 404.
Check api's logs and the consumer's warn log.

### DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowStatsStalled

No window rows posted (`full_coverage_consumer_window_rows_posted_total`)
while windowed stats are on. The consumer posts on every stats write (about a
minute) once its startup replay is done, so look for a stuck replay, a
population that never loaded, or failing POSTs
([DistantSignalFullCoverageWindowPostErrors](#distantsignalfullcoveragewindowposterrors)).

## resources

### DistantSignalComponentMemoryHigh

A container in this release's pods has a working set (cadvisor) above
`componentMemory.ratio` of its memory limit (kube-state-metrics), recorded as
`distant_signal:container_memory_working_set:limit_ratio`. It is at risk of
an OOMKill: raise its `resources.limits.memory`, or find the growth.

## notifier

### DistantSignalNotifierPushDropped

The notifier dropped decided notifications
(`notifier_push_dropped_total{reason}`). Delivery is at-most-once by decision
(triage DQ9), so these users may never get them.

- `queue_full` / `user_queue_full`: raise the notifier's push queue capacity
  or worker count.
- `send_failed`: push endpoints are failing; check
  `notifier_push_send_total` by `outcome`.
- `error`: the notifier could not load subscriptions; check the database.

Design: [line-status notifications](superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-line-status-notifications-design.md#delivery-guarantee-at-most-once).

## users

### DistantSignalUserSignupSpike

api created more than `userSignupSpike.threshold` user accounts within the
window. Sign-up is open to any account the IdP admits (in production, any
Discord account through Authentik's Discord source), so a burst is real growth
or scripted sign-ups (spam, abuse of `/chat` or the MCP). Look at the newest
rows in `users` and the IdP's enrolment log. To stop it, restrict the IdP's
enrolment (e.g. bind the application to a group), then revoke the unwanted
sessions: [session revocation](session-revocation.md).

## cold archive

Details: [cold archive](cold-archive.md).

### DistantSignalArchiveUploadFailures

The aggregator failed cold-archive batch uploads or verifications
(`aggregator_archive_upload_failures_total`). With `failurePolicy: retain` the
`trains` table grows past its retention window while this fires; with
`delete`, rows are pruned without an archive. Check the object store and the
aggregator's "archiving a trains batch failed" logs.

### DistantSignalArchiveExpiryErrors

Cold-archive expiry hit errors (`aggregator_archive_expiry_errors_total{stage}`):
a failed LIST or DELETE, or a key refused by the pre-delete check. Expired
objects stay until a run succeeds. Check the object store and the
aggregator's "archive expiry" logs. See
[object expiry](cold-archive.md#object-expiry).

### DistantSignalArchiveExpiryUnmatchedKeys

Expiry listed keys under an archive table prefix that do not match the archive
layout (`aggregator_archive_expiry_skipped_unmatched_total{table}`). They are
never deleted. Something other than the aggregator writes there, or the prefix
is shared; the aggregator logs the first keys each run.

### DistantSignalArchiveExpiryCapReached

An expiry run found more expired objects than
`archive.expiry.maxDeletesPerRun` and stopped at the cap (in dry-run: would
have). Expected once after a long outage or a retention cut; otherwise check
`aggregator_archive_expiry_candidates` before raising the cap.

### DistantSignalArchiveExpiryOverdue

The oldest archived `service_date`
(`aggregator_archive_oldest_service_date_seconds{table}`) is older than
`archive.expiry.retentionDays` plus `overdueGraceDays`. Expiry is not running,
is failing, or is still in dry-run (`aggregator_archive_expiry_dry_run` is 1):
switch `archive.expiry.dryRun` off.

## schedule pipeline

### DistantSignalScheduleReferenceNotSeeded

schedule-reference has been waiting to read its last completed publish from
api (`GET /private/schedule-reference-publishes`), so it publishes nothing
(`schedule_reference_seeded` is 0). Check api and the internal OAuth token
endpoint; the container's warn log names the error.

### DistantSignalScheduleFeedZipRejected

schedule-ingest refused to extract an uploaded CIF delivery zip: over
`MAX_EXTRACTED_BYTES` or `MAX_ZIP_ENTRIES`, or an entry that inflates past
what it declares (PL-5). The timetable is not refreshed until a new upload
replaces it. The ingest container's error log names the reason.

### DistantSignalScheduleFeedIngestRejected

schedule-ingest extracted a CIF delivery but api answered 400/413/422 to its
ingest record, so schedule-reference never sees it. It is not retried until a
new upload replaces it. The ingest container's error log and api's log name
the reason.

### DistantSignalCorpusRejected

schedule-ingest refused a CORPUS extract (not gzip, not the TIPLOCDATA JSON,
too few rows, a row without an NLC, or over the decompression cap) and moved
it to `/data/schedule-feed/corpus/rejected/`. `corpus_locations` keeps the
previous delivery. The ingest container's error log names the reason.

### DistantSignalCorpusStale

The newest loaded Network Rail CORPUS extract was delivered over
`corpusStaleAfterDays` ago (`api_corpus_last_delivered_at_seconds`). CORPUS is
published monthly. Either RDM stopped pushing it (check the SFTP corpus
folder) or schedule-ingest cannot load it (check
[DistantSignalCorpusRejected](#distantsignalcorpusrejected) and the ingest
container's error log). The previous extract stays in use.

### DistantSignalScheduleReferencePublishStale

schedule-reference last fully published a delivery timestamped over
`staleAfterHours` ago
(`schedule_reference_last_published_delivery_timestamp_seconds`). Either no
new delivery arrived (check schedule-ingest and the SFTP upload) or one keeps
failing to publish (check `schedule_reference_publishes_total` by `outcome`,
and the reference container's error log).

### DistantSignalSchedulePublishStagedMismatch

api finished a publish whose staged key count did not match the publisher's
total (`api_schedule_publish_staged_mismatch_total{product}`), so it did not
delete the rows that publish left out. They stay until the next complete
publish. api's warn log has the `publish_id` and both counts.

### DistantSignalScheduleReferencePublishRejected

api refused one of schedule-reference's products with 400, 413 or 422. It is
not retried for this delivery and the delivery is not recorded as published,
so that product keeps its previous rows (a restart tries the delivery again).
Usually a schema skew between the two services or an oversized chunk; the
reference container's error log has api's response body.

### DistantSignalLinePopulationMissing

After 06:00 London, full-coverage-consumer still has no schedule line
population for today's rail day on some lines
(`full_coverage_consumer_population_missing_past_deadline_lines`), so their
full-coverage stats stay Pending. schedule-reference publishes each line's
population for today and tomorrow, so both last night's and the previous
delivery failed to provide it. Check
[DistantSignalScheduleReferencePublishStale](#distantsignalschedulereferencepublishstale)
and the consumer's population reload errors.

## pollers

### DistantSignalPollerFailing

`distant_signal:poller_failing:bool` is 1 for a poller: it completed no
successful cycle and at least one failed one over `pollerFailures.window`, or
more than `failureRatio` of its cycles over `ratioWindow` failed
(`poller_cycle_total{result}`). Its product is going stale. Daily pollers
(stations, tocs) run one cycle a day, so one failed daily cycle is enough.
Check the poller's logs: its upstream feed (National Rail, TfL, Irish Rail),
its credentials or an expired key, and api's `/private` ingest route.

### DistantSignalLdbwsStationStale

The least recently sampled LDBWS station
(`ldbws_stalest_station_age_seconds`) is older than `maxAgeSeconds`. The
rotation (SVC-04) has stopped reaching part of the station list, e.g. every
cycle runs out of budget first; compare `ldbws_stations_attempted_per_cycle`
with `ldbws_stations_total`. Stations LDBWS rejects as an invalid CRS are
excluded (see the next alert).

### DistantSignalLdbwsInvalidCrs

LDBWS answers "Invalid crs code supplied" for a sample station
(`ldbws_invalid_crs_station{crs}`), so no line gets LDBWS data from it. It is
almost certainly a typo in a `lines/*.toml` `sample_stations` entry (e.g.
"ANV" for Andover's "ADV"): fix the file, run
`cargo run -p line-catalogue-validator` and redeploy api. poller-ldbws
excludes the station from the stale-station gauge and re-probes it hourly;
the alert clears once api stops listing it or LDBWS accepts it.

## pgBackRest

Details and procedures: [Postgres PITR](postgres-pitr.md#alerts). The Job
alerts read kube-state-metrics; the archiver alerts read postgres_exporter's
`pg_stat_archiver_*` series.

### DistantSignalPgBackRestCheckFailed

The daily check Job or the weekly verify Job failed within `recentJobWindow`
(`distant_signal:pgbackrest_job_failed:recent`). Either WAL archiving is
broken (the repository is unreachable, or its credentials or stanza are
wrong), `pgbackrest verify` found a bad file, or WAL is missing from the
repository, so point-in-time recovery can't cross that gap. Read the Job's log
to see which: [archiving is failing](postgres-pitr.md#archiving-is-failing),
[WAL gap](postgres-pitr.md#wal-gap).

### DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupFailed

A full or diff backup Job failed within `recentJobWindow`. WAL archiving is
separate and may still be working; the restore window keeps growing from the
last good backup. Read the Job's log and re-run it with
`kubectl create job --from=cronjob/...`.

### DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupStale

Neither the full nor the diff CronJob has succeeded for over `backupMaxAge`
(`kube_cronjob_status_last_successful_time`). Check the Jobs' logs and that
the CronJobs aren't suspended.

### DistantSignalPgBackRestFullBackupStale

The weekly full backup hasn't succeeded for over `fullBackupMaxAge`. Diffs
grow until the next full, and time-based retention keeps the old full (and
its WAL) until a newer one exists. Run the full CronJob by hand.

### DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveFailing

`archive_command` (pgBackRest `archive-push`) has kept failing
(`pg_stat_archiver_failed_count`). WAL piles up in the spool or `pg_wal`; past
`archive.queueMax` pgBackRest drops it, leaving a PITR gap. See
[archiving is failing](postgres-pitr.md#archiving-is-failing).

### DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveStalled

No WAL segment was archived (`pg_stat_archiver_archived_count`) over
`archiveStallWindow`, although `archive_timeout` switches segments every
minute while anything writes. Check the Postgres log, and
`pg_stat_archiver`'s `last_failed_wal`.
