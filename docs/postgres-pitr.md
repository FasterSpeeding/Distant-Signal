# Postgres point-in-time recovery (pgBackRest)

The bundled Postgres can archive its WAL and take backups with pgBackRest,
so the database can be restored to any moment in the retention window
(7 days by default), not just to last night's dump. The feature is **off by
default**: with `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled: false` nothing below
renders, and the Postgres pod is exactly as it is without it.

It doesn't replace the nightly age-encrypted `pg_dump` (Ranma-Config's
`distant-signal-postgres-backup`). Keep that running. It is independent of
pgBackRest, portable across Postgres versions, and encrypted to a key that
never touches the cluster.

- Design: [the backup design](superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-backup-and-observability-gaps-design.md), item 1.
- Chart: `postgresql.pgbackrest.*` and `metrics.prometheusRule.pgbackrest`
  in `charts/distant-signal/values.yaml`; `templates/_pgbackrest.tpl`,
  `templates/postgres-pgbackrest.yaml`,
  `templates/pgbackrest-prometheusrule.yaml`.
- Image: `docker/postgres-pgbackrest.Dockerfile`, with the daily check
  script `docker/pgbackrest/pgbackrest-daily-check.sh`.

## How it works

| Piece | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Image | `postgres-pgbackrest`: the exact `postgres:16.15-trixie` image the chart pins, plus pgBackRest from the PGDG repository, the `pgbackrest-daily-check` script, and `tini` as PID 1 in front of the stock entrypoint (see "Why tini" below). The chart swaps it in for the stock image. |
| WAL archiving | `archive_mode=on`, `archive_command='pgbackrest --stanza=ds --archive-timeout=30 archive-push %p'` and `archive_timeout=60` are added to the Postgres `-c` args. Archiving is asynchronous, through a spool at `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgbackrest-spool` on the data volume, beside `PGDATA`. Each archive-push waits up to `--archive-timeout` (`archive.pushTimeoutSecs`) for the async worker; see "Stopping while S3 is unreachable". |
| Grace period | The Postgres pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and `PGCTLTIMEOUT` default to 6 x `archive.pushTimeoutSecs` + 60 (240 s). Without pgBackRest the pod sets no grace period (Kubernetes' 30 s), unless `postgresql.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is set. |
| Repository | S3 (Thoth on mine-bringer), under `repo.path` in `repo.s3.bucket`. Every file is encrypted client-side with AES-256-CBC before it leaves the pod, and compressed with zstd. |
| Disk-full guard | `archive-push-queue-max` (`archive.queueMax`, 8 GB). If the repository is unreachable for long enough that 8 GB of WAL waits in the queue, pgBackRest **drops** WAL instead of letting `pg_wal` fill the node's disk. Postgres stays up; the dropped WAL is a gap that point-in-time recovery can't cross. |
| Backups | CronJobs `<release>-pgbackrest-full` (Sunday 05:00 UTC) and `-diff` (Monday–Saturday 05:00 UTC). Each backup then runs `expire`, which keeps the full backups and WAL needed to restore to any point in the last `repo.retentionFull` days. |
| Daily check | CronJob `<release>-pgbackrest-check` (07:00 UTC) runs `pgbackrest-daily-check --no-verify`: `pgbackrest check` (archiving works end to end) and a WAL gap check (every segment since the oldest backup on the current timeline is in the repository). |
| Weekly verify | CronJob `<release>-pgbackrest-verify` (Sunday 08:00 UTC, after the full backup) runs `pgbackrest verify`: every file in the repository decrypts and matches its checksum. It reads the whole repository back, so it runs weekly (`backup.verifySchedule`). |
| How the CronJobs run | `kubectl exec` into `<release>-postgres-0`, container `postgres`, so pgBackRest runs next to the data directory with the container's own `PGBACKREST_*` env. Their ServiceAccount's Role allows `get` on that one pod and `pods/exec` on it, and nothing else. They are the only pods in the chart that mount a ServiceAccount token. |
| Secrets | From existing Secrets only: the S3 key pair (`repo.s3.existingSecret`) and the cipher passphrase (`repo.cipher.existingSecret`, defaulting to the same Secret). |

All CronJobs run in `Etc/UTC`, clear of the nightly schedule ingest
(22:00–01:30). See the chart README, "Scheduled jobs and time zones".

### Why tini

The image runs `tini -- docker-entrypoint.sh`, so the postmaster is not
PID 1. Async `archive-push` forks a detached worker, which the kernel
reparents to PID 1. When the postmaster was PID 1 it took that worker's
exit for one of its own server processes: a failing push (exit code 103
for a missing stanza; any S3, credentials, TLS or NetworkPolicy failure)
logged `server process (PID n) exited with exit code 103`, killed every
connection and ran crash recovery, again with every failed push (every
~10 s for a missing stanza; every ~2 minutes for an unreachable S3
endpoint, whose push first retries for a minute).
This happened in production on the first enable (tags without `-tini` are
those images; don't run them). With tini, a failing push only fails and
retries: WAL waits in the spool and `pg_wal`, and the archive alerts fire.

tini forwards the stop signal (the image's `STOPSIGNAL SIGINT`, Postgres'
fast shutdown) to the postmaster and exits with its exit code. The chart
sets only `args` for the Postgres container, never `command`, so the
image's ENTRYPOINT applies; a CI helm-lint step checks that.

### Stopping while S3 is unreachable

On a stop, Kubernetes sends the image's stop signal (SIGINT, a fast
shutdown). Postgres writes its shutdown checkpoint, then waits for the
archiver: it finishes the round of attempts it is in (up to 3, a second
apart) and makes one last round of up to 3. With async archiving each
attempt waits up to pgBackRest's `archive-timeout` for the async worker to
push the segment (pgBackRest 2.59: `unable to push WAL file ... to the
archive asynchronously after 30 second(s)`). With S3 unreachable, that is
up to 6 timed-out attempts.

- `archive.pushTimeoutSecs` (30) sets `--archive-timeout` on
  `archive_command` only. `backup` and `check` keep pgBackRest's 60 s wait
  for the WAL a backup needs. The pgBackRest default of 60 s per attempt
  made a stop take 4-5 minutes (measured 259 s; 171 s at 30 s).
- The pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` defaults to 6 x
  `pushTimeoutSecs` + 60 = 240 s, so the kubelet doesn't SIGKILL Postgres
  after the default 30 s. A SIGKILL is safe (the next start runs crash
  recovery) but slower, and loses the clean shutdown. Set
  `postgresql.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to override it.
- With S3 reachable, a stop takes seconds, as before.

WAL that wasn't archived stays in `pg_wal` (the `.ready` files) and is
pushed after the next start.

### A brand-new database with S3 unreachable

On an empty data volume the image's entrypoint runs initdb, then a
temporary server for its setup, stopped with `pg_ctl`. With pgBackRest on
that server archives too, so with S3 unreachable its stop waits for the
archiver like any stop. `pg_ctl` gives up after `PGCTLTIMEOUT` (default
60 s) and the container exits 1, over and over. The chart sets
`PGCTLTIMEOUT` to the same 6 x `pushTimeoutSecs` + 60 (240 s), so the first
start waits instead (measured: 184 s with S3 unreachable, then the server
came up). This only affects a new data directory.

Still, prefer one of these, which don't need that wait:

- enable pgBackRest on an initialised database (the normal case: step 6 of
  "Enabling it" restarts an existing Postgres), with S3 reachable; or
- for a new install, run the first start with pgBackRest off, so initdb
  finishes without archiving, then enable it.

### The cipher passphrase

**Keep an offline copy of the passphrase, next to the age identity for the
logical dumps.** The repository can't be read without it. A copy that exists
only in the cluster (a Secret, or a SealedSecret whose sealing key lives in
the cluster) is lost with the cluster, and so is every pgBackRest backup.

The passphrase can't be changed for an existing repository. To rotate it,
create a new repository (a new `repo.path`) with the new passphrase, run
`stanza-create` and a full backup there, and delete the old path once its
backups have aged past the retention window.

## Enabling it

1. **Measure WAL.** Take a 24-hour `pg_stat_wal.wal_bytes` delta with the
   current settings, to size the repository:

   ```sql
   SELECT wal_bytes, now() FROM pg_stat_wal;  -- again 24 h later; subtract
   ```

   Expect several times less than the 35 GB/day measured before
   `wal_compression` and the larger `max_wal_size`, and plan on 2–8 GB/day
   stored after zstd. Confirm the repository has room for 7 days of that
   plus two full backups.

2. **Smoke-test the S3 target** from a tailnet machine with pgBackRest
   installed, against a throwaway path (e.g. `/mine-bringer/pgbackrest/smoke`)
   and a throwaway local Postgres: `stanza-create`, `archive-push` (via a
   running server), `backup`, `expire` with `--repo1-retention-full=1` after
   a second full backup (this proves DeleteObjects works), and `restore`. If
   `expire` fails, stop: the repository would grow without bound.

3. **Create the Secret** holding `access-key-id`, `secret-access-key` and
   `cipher-pass` (key names configurable). Generate the passphrase fresh,
   for example `openssl rand -base64 48`, and store it offline first.

4. **Allow egress from the Postgres pod to the S3 endpoint**, and from the
   CronJob pods to the Kubernetes API server, if the namespace has a
   default-deny egress policy. The chart renders neither (its NetworkPolicies
   give the Postgres pod no egress policy).

5. **Build and pin the image.** `containers.yml` publishes
   `postgres-pgbackrest` tagged `pg<postgres>-pgbackrest<version>-tini<version>`
   (e.g. `pg16.15-pgbackrest2.59.1-tini0.19.0`); every push to main
   re-points that tag at a fresh build. Set `postgresql.pgbackrest.image.tag`
   to the tag **with a digest**, read from
   `docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/fasterspeeding/distant-signal/postgres-pgbackrest:pg16.15-pgbackrest2.59.1-tini0.19.0`.
   The chart refuses to render without it, because a per-release default
   would restart Postgres on every deploy. Moving to a newer digest (a
   Postgres patch release, or a pgBackRest bump) restarts Postgres once, so
   do it on purpose. Keep it on the same Postgres version as
   `postgresql.image.tag`. Never use a tag without `-tini`: its postmaster
   is PID 1 and crash-restarts whenever archiving fails (see "Why tini").

6. **Turn it on:** `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled: true`, plus `repo.path`,
   `repo.s3.endpoint`, `repo.s3.port`, `repo.s3.bucket` and
   `repo.s3.existingSecret`. Postgres restarts once, for `archive_mode`.
   Do it on an initialised database with S3 reachable. On a new install,
   start once with pgBackRest off first (see "A brand-new database with
   S3 unreachable").

7. **Create the stanza immediately**, as soon as the restarted pod is
   ready. Until it exists every `archive-push` fails (exit code 103). That
   is harmless with the tini image: Postgres stays up, WAL builds up in
   `pg_wal` and the spool, and `DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveFailing` /
   `ArchiveStalled` fire after their windows. It is not harmless with an
   image whose tag lacks `-tini` (crash recovery every ~10 s). The chart
   doesn't run `stanza-create` for you: as a Helm hook, a failure (S3 down
   during a deploy, or a stanza that no longer matches the database after a
   restore) would fail the release and let Flux roll it back, and a
   `postStart` hook that fails kills the Postgres container.

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec distant-signal-postgres-0 -c postgres -- \
     pgbackrest --log-level-console=info stanza-create
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec distant-signal-postgres-0 -c postgres -- \
     pgbackrest --log-level-console=info check
   ```

8. **Take the first full backup** rather than waiting for Sunday, then run
   the check job:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal create job --from=cronjob/distant-signal-pgbackrest-full pgbackrest-full-initial
   kubectl -n distant-signal logs -f job/pgbackrest-full-initial
   kubectl -n distant-signal create job --from=cronjob/distant-signal-pgbackrest-check pgbackrest-check-initial
   kubectl -n distant-signal logs -f job/pgbackrest-check-initial
   ```

   A backup starts at the next regular checkpoint (up to
   `checkpoint_timeout`, 15 minutes), so the log is quiet for a while at
   first.

9. **Watch it for 7 days**, then run the first drill (below).

`pgbackrest info` shows the backups and the archived WAL range at any time:

```sh
kubectl -n distant-signal exec distant-signal-postgres-0 -c postgres -- pgbackrest info
```

## Alerts

With `metrics.prometheusRule.enabled`, the chart renders a
`<release>-pgbackrest` PrometheusRule. The Job alerts read kube-state-metrics;
the archiver alerts read postgres_exporter's `pg_stat_archiver_*` series
(`stat_archiver` collector, on by default), which this chart doesn't deploy.

| Alert | Severity | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestCheckFailed` | critical | The daily check Job or the weekly verify Job failed. | Read the Job's log (`kubectl logs job/<name>`). A failed `check` means archiving is broken: see "Archiving is failing". A failed `verify` names the bad file: take a full backup, and find out what damaged it. "WAL gap": see below. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupFailed` | warning | A full or diff backup Job failed. | Read the Job's log. Re-run it with `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/...`. A rerun resumes a partial backup. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestBackupStale` | warning | No full or diff backup has succeeded for 30 h. | As above; also check the CronJob isn't suspended. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestFullBackupStale` | warning | No full backup for 8 days. | Run the full CronJob by hand. |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveFailing` | warning | `archive_command` keeps failing. | See "Archiving is failing". |
| `DistantSignalPgBackRestArchiveStalled` | warning | No WAL segment archived for 15 minutes, although `archive_timeout` switches segments every minute while anything writes. | As for failing. |

Ranma-Config's `CronJobNotSucceeding` also covers these CronJobs (their
names don't end in `-backup`).

### Archiving is failing

1. Look for pgBackRest's error in the Postgres log:
   `kubectl logs distant-signal-postgres-0 -c postgres | grep -i -E 'pgbackrest|archive'`.
2. Common causes: the S3 endpoint is down or unreachable (the NetworkPolicy,
   DNS, TLS), the credentials changed, or the stanza doesn't exist
   (`[103]` / `archive.info cannot be opened`: run `stanza-create`, step 7
   of "Enabling it").
   If the log also shows `server process (PID n) exited with exit code`
   followed by `terminating any other active server processes`, the pod is
   running an image without tini: pin a `-tini` tag (see "Why tini").
3. While it fails, WAL waits in the spool and `pg_wal`. Watch the data
   volume. At `archive.queueMax` pgBackRest starts dropping WAL (a WAL gap).
4. Once it's fixed, archiving catches up by itself. Run the check job by
   hand to confirm.

### WAL gap

The check job fails with `WAL gap: N of M segments since the oldest backup
are missing` when WAL was dropped at `queueMax` (or lost some other way).
Point-in-time recovery works up to the start of the gap, and again from the
first backup taken after it, but can't cross it.

1. Fix whatever stopped archiving (above).
2. Take a full backup now:
   `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/distant-signal-pgbackrest-full pgbackrest-full-after-gap`.
3. The check keeps failing until `expire` removes the backups from before
   the gap, i.e. for up to `retentionFull` days. Silence
   `DistantSignalPgBackRestCheckFailed` until then, but only after reading
   each day's log to confirm that the gap is the only failure.

## Point-in-time restore (a real incident)

This replaces the live database. Decide the target time first (UTC), just
before the damage. A time later than the newest archived commit fails
recovery with "recovery ended before configured recovery target was
reached"; to restore to the latest point instead, use `--type=default`
without `--target`/`--target-action`.

1. **Stop Flux** from undoing the changes below:
   `flux suspend helmrelease distant-signal -n distant-signal`.

2. **Stop the writers and Postgres:**

   ```sh
   for d in api aggregator enricher notifier; do
     kubectl -n distant-signal scale deploy "distant-signal-${d}" --replicas=0
   done
   kubectl -n distant-signal scale statefulset distant-signal-postgres --replicas=0
   ```

   Scale down every other workload that writes too (the consumers,
   movement-relay, the pollers and schedulefeed) if the target is far enough
   back that their replays would matter.

3. **Start a restore pod** from the StatefulSet's own pod template, so it
   has the same image, env, Secrets and security context. It gets its own
   component label so the Postgres Service doesn't select it (the Thoth
   egress policy must select it too, see the deploy notes), mounts the data
   volume, and sleeps:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal get statefulset distant-signal-postgres -o json | jq '
     .spec.template
     | .metadata.labels["app.kubernetes.io/component"] = "pgbackrest-restore"
     | {apiVersion: "v1", kind: "Pod",
        metadata: {name: "pgbackrest-restore", labels: .metadata.labels},
        spec: (.spec
          | .containers = [.containers[0]
              | .command = ["sleep", "infinity"] | .args = []
              | del(.readinessProbe, .livenessProbe, .startupProbe)]
          | .volumes = ((.volumes // []) + [{name: "data",
              persistentVolumeClaim: {claimName: "data-distant-signal-postgres-0"}}]))}
   ' | kubectl apply -f -
   kubectl -n distant-signal wait --for=condition=Ready pod/pgbackrest-restore
   ```

4. **Keep the damaged data directory** and restore into a fresh one. The
   rename doubles the disk use for a while (local-path has room):

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec pgbackrest-restore -- sh -c \
     'mv "$PGDATA" "$PGDATA.damaged-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)" && mkdir -m 0700 "$PGDATA"'
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec pgbackrest-restore -- \
     pgbackrest --log-level-console=info --type=time \
       --target="2026-10-01 12:34:00+00" --target-action=promote restore
   ```

   (If disk is short, skip the rename and add `--delta` to restore over the
   damaged directory in place. Nothing of it is kept then.)

5. **Delete the restore pod and start Postgres.** It replays WAL from the
   repository up to the target, then promotes onto a new timeline and
   carries on archiving:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal delete pod pgbackrest-restore
   kubectl -n distant-signal scale statefulset distant-signal-postgres --replicas=1
   kubectl -n distant-signal logs -f distant-signal-postgres-0 -c postgres
   ```

   Wait for `database system is ready to accept connections`.

6. **Check the app role's password.** A physical restore brings back
   `pg_authid` as of the target. If the password in the Secret changed
   since then (a rotation), set it again:
   `ALTER ROLE distant_signal PASSWORD ...` through `kubectl exec ... psql`,
   reading the password from the Secret without echoing it. With
   `postgresql.roles` (docs/postgres-app-role.md) the same goes for the
   owner, app, exporter and dump roles; with `roles.setupJob.enabled`, the
   next `helm upgrade` (or Flux resume) resets all four from their Secrets.

7. **Run the verification queries** (below), then scale the workloads back
   up and resume Flux:
   `flux resume helmrelease distant-signal -n distant-signal`. Migrations are
   a no-op: the schema is at the target point, and the api applies anything
   newer on start.

8. **Take a full backup** so the new timeline has one:
   `kubectl create job --from=cronjob/distant-signal-pgbackrest-full pgbackrest-full-after-restore`.
   Delete the kept `pgdata.damaged-*` directory once nobody needs it.

### Verification queries

Run after every restore and every drill:

```sql
-- Should match the migrations the running api image ships.
SELECT max(version) FROM _sqlx_migrations WHERE success;
-- Within the expected change from the source.
SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM users) AS users, (SELECT count(*) FROM journeys) AS journeys,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM train_subscriptions) AS subscriptions, (SELECT count(*) FROM trains) AS trains;
-- Close to the target time: movement events arrive every few seconds.
SELECT max(received_at) FROM train_movement_events;
SELECT max(created_at) FROM trains;
SELECT max(created_at) FROM journeys;
-- Should return no rows.
SELECT indexrelid::regclass FROM pg_index WHERE NOT indisvalid;
```

## Drill

Monthly for the first quarter, then quarterly. **Never touch production for
a drill**: restore into a scratch pod with an `emptyDir`, never into the
real data volume, and start it with **archiving off**, so it can't push a
new timeline into the production repository.

1. Start a scratch pod from the StatefulSet's pod template, with an
   `emptyDir` of about twice the database size instead of the data volume,
   its own component label (the Thoth egress policy must select it), and
   small requests, because the node has little CPU or memory left to
   request:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal get statefulset distant-signal-postgres -o json | jq '
     .spec.template
     | .metadata.labels["app.kubernetes.io/component"] = "pgbackrest-restore"
     | {apiVersion: "v1", kind: "Pod",
        metadata: {name: "pgbackrest-drill", labels: .metadata.labels},
        spec: (.spec
          | .containers = [.containers[0]
              | .command = ["sleep", "infinity"] | .args = []
              | .resources = {requests: {cpu: "100m", memory: "512Mi"}, limits: {memory: "2Gi"}}
              | del(.readinessProbe, .livenessProbe, .startupProbe)]
          | .volumes = ((.volumes // []) + [{name: "data", emptyDir: {sizeLimit: "15Gi"}}]))}
   ' | kubectl apply -f -
   kubectl -n distant-signal wait --for=condition=Ready pod/pgbackrest-drill
   ```

2. Restore to about an hour ago, and time it:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec pgbackrest-drill -- sh -c '
     mkdir -m 0700 "$PGDATA" && date -u &&
     pgbackrest --log-level-console=info --type=time \
       --target="$(date -u -d "1 hour ago" "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S+00")" \
       --target-action=promote restore && date -u'
   ```

3. Start Postgres with archiving off, on the local socket only, with a small
   `shared_buffers` (the pod keeps the production memory limit), and time
   the WAL replay:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n distant-signal exec pgbackrest-drill -- sh -c '
     date -u && pg_ctl -D "$PGDATA" -l /tmp/drill.log -w -t 3600 \
       -o "-c archive_mode=off -c listen_addresses= -c shared_buffers=256MB" start && date -u'
   ```

4. Run the verification queries:
   `kubectl -n distant-signal exec -it pgbackrest-drill -- psql -U distant_signal -d distant_signal`.
   `max(created_at)` should be close to the target.

5. Record the RTO: restore time plus replay time. The earlier estimate is
   30–90 minutes; the first drill replaces it with a measurement.

6. `kubectl -n distant-signal delete pod pgbackrest-drill`.

Keep drilling the logical dump too: once a quarter, restore the latest
`.sql.gz.age` with the procedure in Ranma-Config's `backup-encryption.md`.
That drill needs the offline age identity, so it stays manual.

## Turning it off

Set `postgresql.pgbackrest.enabled: false`. Postgres restarts once, on the
stock image with archiving off, and the CronJobs, Role and alerts are
removed. The repository is left as it is: delete `repo.path` from the
bucket by hand once its backups are no longer wanted. They hold personal
data until they're deleted (see [personal-data-retention.md](personal-data-retention.md)).

## Personal data

Backups hold personal data. With weekly full backups and 7-day time
retention, a deleted row can stay in the repository for up to about 14
days: the 7-day window, plus up to 7 days until the full backup before it
expires. The account and privacy pages say "up to 14 days"; keep
`repo.retentionFull` and the backup schedules within that (see
[personal-data-retention.md](personal-data-retention.md)).
