//! `poller-ldbws`: samples live departure-board data for every station any
//! line's inference logic depends on, and forwards parsed `StationSample`s
//! to the `api` crate's `/private/station-samples` ingestion endpoint.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-ldbws-sampler-poller-design.md`
//! for the full design and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-06-ldbws-sampler-poller.md`
//! for the RDM facts this is built against (a documentation-discovery pass
//! against a fetched Swagger spec for RDM's Live Departure Board REST
//! product, `GetDepBoardWithDetails`). The exact RDM product-slug segment
//! of the base URL is a documented gap carried into `config.rs`, where it
//! is env-configurable rather than guessed.
//!
//! Request volume (LEG-18): the current cadence and station set were
//! accepted by the repo owner under the Rail Data Marketplace terms on
//! 2026-09-27, so the defaults are unchanged. `config.rs` has three
//! operator knobs, all off by default, for cutting the volume without a
//! code change: an hourly request budget (`budget.rs`), a pinned-lines-only
//! filter and a station cap (both applied by `api`).
//!
//! Unlike the other three pollers, this one calls a second `api` endpoint
//! first (`GET /private/sample-stations`) to learn which CRS codes to
//! sample, then makes one LDBWS call *per station* each cycle — there is
//! no bulk/multi-station LDBWS operation.
