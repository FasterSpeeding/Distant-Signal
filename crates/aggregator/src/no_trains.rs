//! "No trains between X and Y": an incident summary that closes a section
//! of line, resolved against the stations of one matched line.
//!
//! The phrase matches none of `aggregation::severity_from_incident`'s
//! keywords, and an operator-wide report is capped at Minor Delays, so a
//! whole branch closed ("No trains between Par and Newquay") read Minor
//! (2026-10-02 production study: 2,749 in-effect operator-wide rows were
//! Minor against 33 Part Suspended). When BOTH ends resolve to stations of
//! the line, that is line-specific evidence:
//!
//! - the closed section covers at least a third of the line's stations
//!   ([`PART_SUSPENDED_SHARE`]): **Part Suspended** (a branch, or most of a
//!   line);
//! - a shorter section of a longer line: **Reduced Service** -- the rest of
//!   the line runs, so the whole line is not shown at the Severe tier. The
//!   status still names the section (the summary, `affected_stops` and
//!   `affected_routes`).
//!
//! See the "Decisions (2026-10-02, incident sections)" section of
//! docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-27-full-coverage-windowed-stats-design.md.
