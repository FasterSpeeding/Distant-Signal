//! `tfl-stops/1` (stream `ds:ingest:tfl-stops`; docs/superpowers/specs/
//! 2026-10-20-tfl-stop-lookup-design.md §2): the body is a
//! `Vec<common::tfl_stops::TflStop>`, poller-tfl's whole daily stops
//! snapshot in one part, written by `ds_store::tfl_stops::replace`.
//!
//! The snapshot replaces `tfl_stops` and rebuilds `tfl_stop_crs`, so it is
//! applied only whole (no `batch`, or `parts == 1`): a part of a split
//! snapshot would delete every stop the other parts carry. A split one is
//! poison (the producer never splits it). An empty snapshot, and one older
//! than the stored stops, write nothing and are not errors. A row the
//! store refuses before writing (not a NaPTAN id, no name, no mode) is left
//! out and logged.
