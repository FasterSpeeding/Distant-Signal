//! Auto-suggest notices (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-mid-journey-changes-design.md
//! §6): when one of a user's journeys breaks, one push that says what
//! happened and the next option, deep-linking to the suggestions the api
//! already planned.
//!
//! The api's break sweep writes `journey_breaks` (with `suggestions`); this
//! cycle only reads the open ones and decides ([`decide_break_notice`]):
//!
//! - **one per break**, and again only when it gets worse (`severity`
//!   above `notified_severity`);
//! - **quiet once acted on**: an accepted, dismissed or recovered break is
//!   not open, and one opened in the last 10 minutes at the same severity
//!   is skipped;
//! - **confirmed**: a break seen by one sweep only waits for the next
//!   (about a minute), unless a train was cancelled (§11);
//! - **opt-outs**: the user's `notification_preferences.journey_suggestions`
//!   and the journey's `suggestions_muted` suppress the push (the in-app
//!   banner still shows, and the train's own push then goes out as usual);
//! - **owner only**, and never for "I missed this train" (the user is
//!   already in the app);
//! - **one push per user per train** (§6.3): the notice is that train's
//!   push. Its delivery writes the train's `train_notification_state` at
//!   the equivalent rank, the train path (delay and cancel pushes, and
//!   DS-127's predicted late starts) defers to an open break on the
//!   train ([`break_owns_train`]), and the queue drops a queued plain push
//!   for the train (`push_queue`'s supersede). Its `tag` is the train's, so
//!   a plain push that raced it is replaced on the phone.
