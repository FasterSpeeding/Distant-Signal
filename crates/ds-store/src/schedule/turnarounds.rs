//! `schedule_turnarounds`: each passenger train's previous working, for the
//! pre-departure late-start prediction
//! (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-21-pre-departure-prediction-design.md,
//! section 4 and decision Q1).
//!
//! Phase 1 infers the link from the platform sequence ("option A"): for a
//! passenger train's origin call with a booked platform, take the
//! timetable event just before its departure at the same station and
//! platform. The link holds when that event is a terminating arrival of a
//! passenger train run by the same operator, 2 to 60 minutes before the
//! departure. Any other event in between (another train's departure, a
//! call, a pass at that platform) breaks the chain, so no link is made.
//! Over 2026-10-15..21 this paired 78% of passenger origins with a booked
//! platform, and 92% of the trains whose incoming train had eaten the whole
//! turnaround started at least 3 minutes late (spec section 3a).
//!
//! [`replace_inferred_for_date`] rebuilds one service date's inferred rows
//! in one statement, from `schedule_calling_points_full` and
//! `schedule_services` for that date and the day before (an overnight
//! arrival can form a train the next morning). schedule-reference runs it
//! after publishing the date's calling points and services. Rows with
//! `link = 'association'` (phase 2) are never touched by it.
