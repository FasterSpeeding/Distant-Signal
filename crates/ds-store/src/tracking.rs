/// in either caller:
/// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-shared-train-status-write-race-design.md`

/// The mechanism is **event-time monotonicity, not wall-clock/commit
/// order**: `event_time` below is `COALESCE(event.actual_timestamp,
/// event.planned_timestamp)` -- the incoming event's own real-world
/// timestamp, not `NOW()` (which `updated_at` already records, and which
/// provides no protection at all since it always advances forward
/// regardless of which writer produced it). The `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`'s
/// `WHERE EXCLUDED.event_time IS NULL OR EXCLUDED.event_time >=
/// train_current_state.event_time OR train_current_state.event_time IS
/// NULL` clause makes the whole `UPDATE` a no-op whenever the incoming
/// event is OLDER than what's already stored, independent of commit order
/// between the two writers -- so this is NOT dead code or a redundant
/// restatement of the `ON CONFLICT` target; it is the actual fix.
///
/// **A no-timestamp incoming event always applies, but never regresses a
/// known `event_time`.** Not every message this function is called for
/// actually carries a timestamp -- e.g. a Cancellation with a missing or
/// malformed `canx_timestamp` (both `crates/trust-consumer/src/process.rs`
/// and `crates/trust-backlog-consumer/src/process.rs` build a
/// Cancellation's `actual_timestamp` from
/// `common::trust_timestamp::parse_trust_epoch_millis_pair(None,
/// canx_timestamp.as_deref(), ...).actual`, `None` on either a missing or
/// an unparseable value, with `planned_timestamp`
/// always `None` for that message shape) -- so `event_time` here can
/// legitimately be `NULL` even once the stored row's `event_time` is
/// already known. The first `EXCLUDED.event_time IS NULL` branch exists
/// specifically for that case: an event we have no real-world time for is
/// still the best information available and must still apply (matching
/// this function's pre-guard behaviour for exactly that case), rather than
/// being silently and PERMANENTLY dropped -- without this branch, `NULL >=
/// x` is SQL's UNKNOWN, `train_current_state.event_time IS NULL` is FALSE
/// once a real `event_time` is stored, and `UNKNOWN OR FALSE` never
/// satisfies `WHERE`, so every future write to that `trains_id` (including
/// ones that DO carry a real, newer timestamp) would silently no-op
/// forever -- worse than having no guard at all. Symmetrically, `SET
/// event_time = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.event_time, train_current_state.event_time)`
/// (rather than a bare `EXCLUDED.event_time`) means a no-timestamp write
/// updates every other column normally but leaves the stored `event_time`
/// exactly as it was -- if it instead clobbered `event_time` back to
/// `NULL`, that would re-open the `train_current_state.event_time IS NULL`
/// branch for every subsequent call, permanently defeating the guard for
/// this `trains_id` after just one no-timestamp event.

/// **No-op guard (DB2-3).** trust-consumer fans one movement out as one
/// message per subscriber of the same train, so the same state arrived N

/// whose linked `trains` row still lacks schedule data. It should not, for
/// a concrete reason rather than a stylistic one: this sweep's only tool is
/// `attempt_schedule_match`, which is keyed on `(origin CRS, departure
/// time)` -- exactly the pair such a row does not have and cannot derive.
/// Widening the `WHERE` would select rows the sweep can do nothing with.
///
/// **Re-examined again for the finding that `trains_id IS NULL` alone is
/// NOT sufficient to guarantee non-NULL `pin_*` columns.** `trains_id` is
/// `ON DELETE SET NULL` (`20260906100000_trains.sql:38`): once
/// `aggregator::queries::prune_trains` deletes a `trains` row, any
/// still-`pending` subscription pointing at it (an NR-primary row that
/// never got a schedule match, e.g. a train that never ran) has its
/// `trains_id` nulled out and reappears in this very query's result --
/// now indistinguishable, by `trains_id` alone, from a fresh NR-primary
/// row, but with `pin_origin_crs`/`pin_scheduled_departure` NULL. The
/// `WHERE` clause below now also excludes those explicitly (rather than
/// relying solely on `PendingSchedulePin`'s fields being `Option` to avoid
/// a decode error), since this sweep has nothing to do with such a row
/// either way -- same reasoning as the paragraph above, just reached via a
/// different route into this table's state space. See
/// `list_pending_pins_for_schedule_match_excludes_a_pruned_nr_primary_row_with_null_pins`.
///
/// What those rows get instead:
/// * LIVE data -- `trust-consumer` sees them through
///   `list_active_tracked_trains`' `LEFT JOIN trains`, matches their
///   `train_uid` straight off an Activation, and their movements flow
///   normally. Proven end to end by
///   `an_nr_primary_subscription_receives_live_movement_events` in this
///   module's own `db_tests`, not assumed.
/// * HISTORICAL data -- `routes::train::enrich_shared_train` replays the
///   retained `trust_event_backlog` at track time, and uses the replayed
///   origin departure's own `(CRS, time)` to run a real schedule match
///   (`schedule_matching::attempt_schedule_match_for_shared_train`).
///
/// The one residual gap, named rather than hidden: a train tracked
/// NR-primary that has NOT yet run (nothing in the backlog) acquires
/// schedule data only if something else supplies a `(CRS, time)` for it
/// later -- another subscriber's legacy pin, or a re-track. Live TRUST
/// still resolves its `train_id` and movements; it is only origin/
/// destination/calling points that stay `NULL`. Closing that needs a
/// schedule lookup keyed on `train_uid` alone, which no index in this
/// codebase supports today; out of scope for this fix.
///
/// **`service_date` floor, added for the 2026-09-25 review finding (Medium
/// 7), mirroring `list_pending_pins_for_backlog_match`'s own identical
/// bound.** This query had none: a pin that can never match -- its
/// `schedule_line_population` was pruned, its origin CRS is on no line, its
/// schedule simply does not exist -- was re-selected and re-attempted on
/// EVERY sweep tick, forever, for as long as the row stayed `'pending'`.
/// Each attempt is a `list_stanox_crs_for_crs` read plus one
/// `schedule_line_population` read AND a full JSONB parse per candidate line
/// (a whole day of schedules for that line), so the futile work is
/// substantial, unbounded in time, and grows monotonically with every such
/// pin a user ever creates. `CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 days'` is the same
/// figure and the same reasoning as the backlog sibling (see its doc
/// comment): one full day of margin past the shortest realistic retention
/// window, so a boundary row is never dropped moments before it would have
/// matched. Nothing is lost past the floor that was reachable anyway -- a
/// schedule match needs that date's `schedule_line_population`, and
/// `schedule-reference` only publishes a rolling window of upcoming dates.
///
/// **Upper bound, API-6.** Both sweeps also skip a pin dated more than
/// [`SWEEP_MAX_DAYS_AHEAD`] days ahead: nothing is published that far out,
/// so every attempt was futile, and a pin dated 2090 (possible before
