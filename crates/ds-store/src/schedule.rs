//! The schedule publish protocol and products: `SchedulePublishPart`
//! (with `new` validating the chunk parameters), the publish-key SQL,
//! the destination-departure, calling-point, network-departure and
//! line-population upserts and readers, the feed-ingest and
//! reference-publish markers, and `schedule_feed_ingest_problem`
//! (spec §5.2).
//!
//! Filled by plan task 1A.7. The submodules live under `schedule/`; every
//! item is re-exported here, so callers name `ds_store::schedule::…`.
//!
//! - `markers`: the feed-ingest and reference-publish markers.
//! - `population`: the per-line schedule population.
//! - `publish`: the network, destination and calling-point products and
//!   the chunked diff-publish protocol.
