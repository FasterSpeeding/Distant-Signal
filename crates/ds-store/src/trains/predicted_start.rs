//! A predicted late start from the train's previous working
//! (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-21-pre-departure-prediction-design.md,
//! sections 5 and 3a, and the 2026-10-22 decisions).
//!
//! Before TRUST reports a train T, DS knows nothing live about it. But the
//! unit that forms T usually arrives on an earlier train P, its previous
//! working (`schedule_turnarounds`). If P is late enough that the booked
//! turnaround cannot absorb it, T starts late:
//!
//! ```text
//! excess = A - S          A: P's delay at its terminus, S: booked turnaround
//! late   = max(0, excess + TURN_MIN)
//! ```
//!
//! `A` is P's current TRUST delay (uniform propagation, no recovery), or,
//! when P has not started either, P's own predicted late start from its
//! previous working (two links deep at most).
//!
//! **Confidence.**
//!
//! - `high`: one link, P's data is live and fresh (or P has arrived), the
//!   excess is between 0 and [`MEDIUM_EXCESS_LIMIT`] (P has eaten the whole
//!   slack), and the operator is not in [`MEDIUM_CAPPED_OPERATORS`]. Over a
//!   week of TRUST actuals, 92% of such trains started at least 3 minutes
//!   late, with a mean error of 2.1 minutes. Only `high` sends a push.
//! - `medium`: one link, fresh, excess at most [`MEDIUM_EXCESS_LIMIT`].
//! - `low`: the excess is above [`MEDIUM_EXCESS_LIMIT`], P's data is older
//!   than [`FRESHNESS`], or the prediction is two links deep. Shown only as
//!   "may start late", never as a number (`late_minutes` is `None`).
//! - Nothing above [`SHOW_EXCESS_LIMIT`] of excess (the unit was most
//!   likely swapped), nothing when P is cancelled, nothing when the
//!   prediction is 0, and nothing once T itself has a TRUST report.
//!
//! The rule is pure ([`rule`], [`assemble`]); [`predict_for_trains`] loads
//! the evidence for a batch of trains in one query.
