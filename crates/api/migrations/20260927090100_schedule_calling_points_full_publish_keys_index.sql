-- order reasoning as
-- 20260927090000_schedule_destination_departures_publish_keys_index.sql:
-- `publish_id` leads (serving `summarize` and `drop_publish`), followed by
-- the `delete_missing` anti-join's equality columns so a nested-loop plan's
-- inner side is an index probe rather than a seq scan of every staged key.
