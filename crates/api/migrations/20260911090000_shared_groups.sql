-- Shared groups: named groups with join-link-based membership. A tracked
-- train added to a group becomes visible to other group members (custom
-- name + live status, never tickets). See
-- docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-shared-groups-design.md.
--
-- Four tables, not three:
--   groups              -- one row per group. `id` is a short random id,
--                          the same shape as auth::generate_session_token()
--                          (base64url of 32 random bytes), doubling as a
--                          non-guessable URL identifier.
--   group_members        -- membership + role. Three tiers, not two: the
--                          creator is a PERMANENT `owner`, inserted in the
--                          same transaction as the group -- never
--                          removable/demotable by a co-`admin` (§2.1).
--   group_trains          -- a JOIN TABLE (not a `group_id` FK on
--                          train_subscriptions) so one train can be shared
--                          into more than one group at once (§2.2). This
--                          repo already paid the cost of under-modeling an
--                          analogous relationship once for
--                          tracked_train_tickets
--                          (20260901140000_standalone_tickets.sql) -- a
--                          join table avoids repeating that here.
--   group_invite_links     -- reusable, rotatable join links. `token` reuses
--                          auth::generate_session_token()'s own opaque,
--                          high-entropy shape directly as the primary key
--                          (unlike sessions.id, this is NOT hashed --
--                          the token doubles as a bearer capability meant
--                          to be shared verbatim via a URL, and a group's
--                          own membership list is the actual access-control
--                          boundary once someone has joined, not secrecy of
--                          this table's contents).

-- HAZARD for whoever adds user deletion: `user_id ON DELETE CASCADE` removes
-- the owner's own membership row directly, bypassing
-- `groups::remove_member`'s ownership-transfer/group-deletion logic
-- entirely. `groups::get_group_detail`'s inner join on `role = 'owner'`
-- would then find no owner row and 404 for every remaining member forever
-- -- an unreadable-but-not-deleted group. No user-deletion feature exists
-- today, so this is latent, not an active bug; a future one should either
-- run `remove_member`-equivalent logic before deleting the user, or
-- otherwise repair/reassign ownership as part of that deletion.
