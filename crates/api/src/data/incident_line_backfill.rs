//! Recompute `incidents.affected_lines` for rows already in the table.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `queries::upsert_incidents` fills `affected_lines` for every incident it
//! writes, and `poller-incidents` re-sends the whole current feed every
//! cycle -- so any incident still *in* the feed is corrected within one
//! poll of the column being added. Incidents that have dropped out of the
//! feed are never written again, and those are precisely the rows the
//! incident archive exists to serve: at the time of writing, all 1507 rows
//! in production carry `affected_lines = '{}'` inherited from the
//! migration's default, and would stay that way forever.
//!
//! # Why a binary rather than SQL in the migration
//!
//! The line attribution is not derivable in SQL. It is
//! `common::matcher::lines_affected_by` -- substring matching each line's
//! `match_keywords`/`excluded_keywords` against the incident prose, gated
//! by the feed's structured operator list, with a cross-line post-filter
//! over the whole match set. That lives in Rust and reads the `lines/*.toml`
//! catalogue; a migration cannot call it. Same reasoning, and the same
//! shape, as `legacy_backfill`/`backfill_trains`.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Idempotent and re-runnable. It only ever writes `affected_lines`, a
//! column nothing else owns, and only for rows whose recomputed value
//! actually differs from what is stored -- so a second run reports zero
//! updates. Running it again after a `lines/*.toml` change is the supported
//! way to propagate that change to archived incidents.
