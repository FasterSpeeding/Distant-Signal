//! Guards the one migration hazard this crate cannot express in SQL: an index
//! built inside sqlx's wrapping transaction takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`-grade
//! lock (a plain `SHARE` lock on the table, which blocks every `INSERT`,
//! `UPDATE` and `DELETE`) for the whole duration of the build.
//!
//! That matters here more than in most codebases, because of WHERE migrations
//! run. `crates/api/src/main.rs` calls `sqlx::migrate!().run(...)` BEFORE it
//! binds its listener, so:
//!
//! 1. writes to the table are blocked for the length of the index build; and
//! 2. `/public/health` does not answer for the length of the index build
//!    either, so the startup probe's total budget
//!    (`api.probes.startup` in `charts/distant-signal/values.yaml`) is a hard
//!    ceiling on it. Exceed that and the kubelet SIGKILLs the container, the
//!    DDL transaction rolls back, and the next start repeats it from scratch
//!    -- a crash loop that never converges.
//!
//! Postgres's answer is `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, which takes only a lock
//! that permits writes. It cannot run inside a transaction block, which is
//! exactly why sqlx offers a per-file opt-out: a migration file whose FIRST
//! line is `-- no-transaction` is executed without the wrapping transaction
//! (`sqlx-core-0.8.6/src/migrate/source.rs:127` --
//! `let no_tx = sql.starts_with("-- no-transaction");`).
//!
//! Both halves of that were verified for real against Postgres 18 with
//! sqlx-cli 0.8.6 on 2026-09-25:
//!
//! * `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` with no opt-out ->
//!   `error: while executing migration ...: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot
//!   run inside a transaction block`
//! * the same DDL with `-- no-transaction` as line 1 -> applied cleanly, and
//!   `pg_index.indisvalid` = true.
//!
//! # Why the existing offenders are grandfathered rather than fixed
//!
//! Every file in `GRANDFATHERED` below builds a non-concurrent index on a
//! table that already existed before that migration ran, and every one of
//! them has ALREADY BEEN APPLIED in production. sqlx validates the checksum of
//! every applied migration on connect, so editing one of those files does not
//! improve anything -- it breaks startup on precisely the databases the change
//! was meant to protect. This repo already documents that constraint, for the
//! same reason, in `docs/shared-train-identity-backfill.md`:
//!
//! > the migration has already been applied in every existing environment:
//! > sqlx validates the checksum of every applied migration on connect, so
//! > editing that file would break `sqlx migrate run` on exactly the databases
//! > the check was meant to protect -- and would never re-run there anyway.
//!
//! Also verified for real on 2026-09-25 rather than assumed: applying the
//! concurrent rewrite to
//! `20260906111500_trust_event_backlog_train_uid_index.sql` in place, against
//! a database that already had it, produced
//! `error: migration 20260906111500 was previously applied but has been
//! modified` from `sqlx migrate run`, and `sqlx migrate info` reported
//! `20260906111500/installed (different checksum)`. In production that is
//! `sqlx::migrate!()` returning `Err` before `api` ever binds -- i.e. a
//! permanent CrashLoopBackOff, made worse by the api Deployment's
//! `strategy: Recreate`.
//!
//! A new migration cannot retroactively help either: the old file still runs
//! first on any database that has not seen it, and on a database that has,
//! there is nothing left to build. So the honest scope is forward-looking,
//! which is what this test enforces: the NEXT index migration must use the
//! concurrent pattern, and this list must not grow.
