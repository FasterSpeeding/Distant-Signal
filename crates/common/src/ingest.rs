//! Shared HTTP ingestion contract between the RDM pollers
//! (`crates/poller-incidents`, `crates/poller-stations`, `crates/poller-tocs`,

//! `post_batch`/`time_until_next_poll` consumer all the same), and the `api`
//! crate's `/private/*` endpoints (`crates/api/src/routes/ingest.rs`, gated

//! Single source of truth for the POST-batch-and-log pattern every real

//! obtained from `crate::oauth_client::OAuthTokenCache` -- see
//! docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-internal-service-oauth2-design.md
//! Decision 5. Previously this carried a bespoke shared-secret custom
//! header; that scheme is retired, not kept alongside this one (no
//! dual-acceptance window -- see that document's Decision 5 and this
//! plan's own Global Constraints).
