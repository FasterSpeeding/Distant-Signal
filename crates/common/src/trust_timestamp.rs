//! Parsing and plausibility-guarding for TRUST/RDM's millisecond-epoch
//! timestamp fields (`planned_timestamp`/`actual_timestamp`/
//! `canx_timestamp`).
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-trust-schedule-delay-validation-findings.md's
//! "2026-09-11: Task 4 goes live" section documents a sustained,
//! multi-hour live-feed anomaly: the raw TRUST/RDM Kafka feed's
//! `planned_timestamp`/`actual_timestamp` fields arrive already inflated by
//! a near-constant ~59-60 minutes. This was confirmed via two
//! independently-written, byte-identical `parse_epoch_millis`
//! implementations (`crates/trust-consumer/src/process.rs` and
//! `crates/trust-backlog-consumer/src/process.rs`, both just
//! `chrono::DateTime::from_timestamp_millis(raw.parse().ok()?)`,
//! timezone-safe by construction) against a sustained live sample, and is
//! NOT explained by this codebase's own DB session timezone or column
//! types (`TIMESTAMPTZ` throughout, confirmed against
//! `crates/api/migrations/20260828120000_train_tracking.sql`).
//!
//! The best-evidenced hypothesis: whatever upstream system stamps these
//! fields is emitting Europe/London LOCAL wall-clock time (BST, currently
//! UTC+1) but labelling it as though it were already UTC -- a missed
//! timezone conversion one hop upstream of this codebase, which this
//! codebase cannot fix at the source and has NOT had vendor-confirmed.
//! [`parse_trust_epoch_millis_pair`] below applies that correction, but
//! only as a *guarded* one -- see its own doc comment for why and how it
//! falls back when the correction doesn't actually help. It also takes a
//! `correction_enabled` kill switch (each consuming crate's own
//! `trust_timestamp_correction_enabled` config flag) so an operator can
//! disable the correction outright if this hypothesis ever stops holding.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in `common`
//!
//! `trust-consumer` and `trust-backlog-consumer` each used to define their
//! own byte-identical, uncorrected `parse_epoch_millis` -- the exact
//! duplication that let the corruption above go unnoticed for as long as
//! it did (it took two independent confirmations to be believed). This
//! module exists so there is now exactly one implementation for both
//! crates to share, and it can't drift again.
//!
//! ## One decision per message, not one per field
//!
//! A single TRUST message (a Movement) carries TWO timestamp fields --
//! `planned_timestamp` and `actual_timestamp` -- that many downstream call
//! sites (`crates/api/src/data/journey.rs`'s per-stop `delay_minutes`,
//! this crate's own top-level `delay_minutes`) diff against EACH OTHER,
//! relying on both having been skewed (or not) by exactly the same amount.
//! Calling the single-field [`parse_trust_epoch_millis`] independently on
//! each field breaks that invariant: `actual_timestamp`'s own
//! `received_at` anchor makes its correction plausible far more often than
//! `planned_timestamp`'s does (a train running more than ~10 minutes EARLY
//! makes the corrected `planned_timestamp` alone look implausibly far
//! *ahead* of receipt, even though `actual_timestamp` corrects cleanly) --
//! so the two fields can independently land on OPPOSITE corrected-or-raw
//! outcomes, desyncing them by a full hour. [`parse_trust_epoch_millis_pair`]
//! exists specifically to prevent that: it makes the plausibility decision
//! ONCE, anchored on `actual_timestamp` (the only field with a meaningful
//! `received_at` anchor to judge plausibility by), and applies that same
//! outcome uniformly to both fields. Every real call site
//! (`trust-consumer`/`trust-backlog-consumer`'s Movement and Cancellation
//! handling) uses this pairwise function, never the single-field one, for
//! exactly this reason.

///
/// `chrono_tz::Europe::London::from_local_datetime` forces two to be

/// might land on the one UK night a year where local time is ambiguous or
/// missing:
///
/// - **Autumn fallback (ambiguous)**: the naive reading occurs twice, once
///   in BST and once in GMT. Disambiguated by `received_at`: whichever of
///   the two candidate UTC instants is genuinely NEARER to `received_at`
///   is chosen. (An earlier version of this function always picked the
///   earlier, BST candidate, reasoning that "the plausibility guard above
///   still catches an implausible result from either choice" -- that
///   claim was false. The guard only rejects a value AHEAD of
///   `received_at`; always picking the earlier candidate only ever moves
///   the result earlier, so a GMT-side instant in the ambiguous overlap
///   hour -- whose raw value was already correct -- could be silently,
///   undetectably shifted an hour early, with nothing catching it. Picking
///   by proximity to `received_at` instead means the guard's own
///   assumption -- "a real receipt time is close to the true event
///   time" -- is what actually decides the ambiguous case, rather than an
///   arbitrary fixed branch.)
/// - **Spring-forward (nonexistent)**: the naive reading falls in the
///   skipped 01:00-02:00 local hour and was never a real Europe/London
///   local time at all. There is no principled corrected value to compute,
///   so this returns `None` -- callers fall back to the raw interpretation.
