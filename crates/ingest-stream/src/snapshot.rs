//! The producer side of every snapshot stream (`INGEST_SINK=stream`; spec
//! §9.1, §11.3, §13.1; plans 3a.7, 3a.8 and 3c.2): a producer's Redis
//! settings ([`RedisArgs`]), encoding a snapshot's rows into parts
//! ([`Snapshot`]), submitting them to a latest-snapshot [`Producer`] as ONE
//! item ([`SnapshotProducer`]), and reading the stream cursor.
//! [`SnapshotStream`] is the one-schema form the `TfL`, tocs and
//! island-of-Ireland pollers use; poller-ldbws and full-coverage-consumer
//! drive [`SnapshotProducer`] directly.
//!
//! The stream is authoritative, and the startup cursor is the stream's
//! newest `produced_at`. Release B (ingest phase 5) removed the
//! `http` and `http+shadow` sinks (the api's `/private` routes), so every
//! producer here only XADDs.
//!
//! **One item per snapshot.** Under [`crate::ProducePolicy::LatestSnapshot`]
//! a newer item replaces an unsent older one, so everything one snapshot
//! carries goes in one item: every part of every schema (full-coverage's
//! three outputs share `ds:ingest:full-coverage` and one item per stats
//! write). Two items would supersede each other. While Redis is
//! unavailable the newest unsent snapshot is kept and retried with backoff
//! (`ingest_stream_produce_dropped_total{reason="superseded"}` counts the
//! replaced ones).
//!
//! **`produced_at` is fixed at encode time.** The parts are encoded once,
//! with the snapshot's fetch time, and the producer re-sends the same bytes
//! on every retry (same keys, same `produced_at`, spec §7.8): nothing here
//! re-stamps at XADD.
//!
//! **The payload is the old HTTP body.** A part's body is the JSON array of
//! its rows, as the retired api route's body was (spec §7.2), split into
//! parts of [`ROWS_PER_PART`].
