/// start offset). This is a hostile-upstream-only risk: Transport for
/// Ireland's real feed is trusted in the ordinary case, and

///
/// An entry's declared "uncompressed size" field in its local/central

/// reasoning `ticket_extraction::reject_pdf_compression_bombs` already
/// documents for why a PDF stream's own declared `/Length` can't be trusted
/// either (`crates/api/src/data/ticket_extraction.rs`). So instead of
/// trusting any declared size, this function borrows that exact mitigation
/// shape: it opens its OWN `zip::ZipArchive` over the already-downloaded
/// bytes, and for every entry, streams its decompressed content through a
/// small, FIXED-SIZE, REUSED buffer -- never a growing `Vec` -- so this
/// function's own memory use stays tiny regardless of how large an entry
/// claims (or turns out) to decompress to. It aborts a single entry's
/// decompression, and immediately rejects the whole archive, the instant
/// the RUNNING TOTAL across every entry seen so far exceeds
/// `MAX_GTFS_INFLATED_BYTES` -- without ever letting any entry fully
/// materialize.
///
/// This duplicates the decompression work `Gtfs::from_reader` goes on to do
/// if this check passes: `Gtfs::from_reader` offers no injectable read
/// wrapper or size-bound option of its own to avoid that (its `ZipArchive`
/// is entirely internal to `read_from_reader`, never exposed to the
/// caller), so there is no way to check as-you-go during the real parse
/// itself. Paying for the decompression twice is a non-issue here: the real
/// feed is small, and this whole poller runs once per poll cycle (minutes
/// apart), not once per inbound request.
///
/// Thin wrapper around [`reject_gtfs_zip_bomb_with_budget`], mirroring
/// [`download_gtfs_zip`]/[`download_capped`]'s own split just below: real
