/// `next_batch` only ever performs ONE id=`0` read per `replaying_pel`
/// activation before switching back to `>` (see that field's own doc) --
/// so the number of entries a single PEL replay actually delivers is
/// capped by this count, not by how many are sitting in the PEL. After a
/// consumer rename (or any event that reassigns a large backlog to a fresh
/// consumer name via `reclaim_stale`), each further batch only becomes
/// deliverable once it has aged past `autoclaim_min_idle` again and the
/// next periodic sweep re-claims it -- i.e. at most one `count`-sized batch
/// per sweep interval. At the old 100 and a 30s sweep interval (this
/// crate's real deployed default -- see e.g. `trust-consumer`'s
/// `redis_autoclaim_min_idle_secs`), a 5,000-entry backlog took roughly 25
/// minutes (50 sweeps * 30s) of delayed, out-of-order replay to fully
/// drain, confirmed against a live cluster.
///
/// 1000 was chosen, not just doubled or left at 100:
/// - It cuts that same 5,000-entry drain to ~5 sweeps (~2.5 minutes),
///   a real improvement rather than a marginal one.
/// - Individual `movement-events` entries are small TRUST envelopes (a
///   handful of string/optional-string fields per `trust-schema::schema`,
///   typically well under 1KB serialized) -- 1000 of them in memory at
///   once is on the order of hundreds of KB to ~1MB, not a memory
///   concern, and nowhere close to problematic relative to the stream's
///   own hard `MAXLEN 500_000` cap.
/// - It does not require also decoupling the sweep-check interval from
///   `autoclaim_min_idle`: that interval already fires as promptly as an
///   entry can become re-eligible (an entry re-claimed at a sweep is only
///   re-claimable once it has been idle for another full
///   `autoclaim_min_idle`, so a same-length check interval already catches
