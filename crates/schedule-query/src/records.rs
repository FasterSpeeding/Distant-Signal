//! Record/struct shapes decoded from CIF `SCHEDULE` (`MCA`) records.
//!
//! Every byte offset documented below was independently re-verified in
//! this crate's own tests against real bytes already quoted in
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-trust-schedule-delay-validation-findings.md`
//! and
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-trust-schedule-delay-inference-timetable-verification.md`
//! -- not re-derived from memory of the published CIF User Spec (RSPS5046),
//! per this repo's "no invented API details" convention. Fields this crate
//! has no real-data-verified use for (Transaction Type, Train Status,
//! Platform, Line) are left undecoded rather than guessed at --
//! see this plan's Non-goals.
//!
//! **The Activity field is no longer on that list (2026-09-25).** Leaving it
//! undecoded was not a neutral scope decision: without it, every calling point
//! carrying a booked departure was published as a boardable departure, so
//! set-down-only, operational and not-advertised-to-the-public stops were
//! offered to users as places to board. Its byte range was verified per record
//! type against this crate's own real fixtures the same way every other offset
//! here was -- see [`CallingPoint::activity`] and
//! [`CallingPoint::is_public_pickup`]. The public arrival/departure times were
//! decoded alongside it, at offsets verified the same way.
//!
//! The `BX` record is no longer entirely
//! undecoded: its ATOC Code field is now decoded (see
//! [`BasicSchedule::operator_atoc`]), and so is its Retail Service ID
//! (see [`BasicSchedule::rsid`]); every other `BX` field remains
//! undecoded for the same no-real-fixture-need reason as above.
