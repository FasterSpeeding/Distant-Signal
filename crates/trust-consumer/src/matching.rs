/// 1. *A wrong train claims a distant pin.* Waterloo can see six or more

///    reported first claimed the pin, with no identity check of any kind --
///    and once claimed, the correct train's own departure found the pin
///    taken and was permanently locked out.
/// 2. *The wrong pin is claimed among several open ones.* `pending` arrives
///    in `tracked_at` (pin-creation) order, so of two pins in range the
///    older one won even when the other was a minute away and it was
///    thirteen.
///
/// Both are closed by matching on what the message itself says its BOOKED
/// time was -- `planned_timestamp`, the WTT time, which `process.rs` already
/// parses and (before this fix) used only for the delay calculation -- with
/// [`SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE_TOLERANCE`]'s tight window, and by taking the
/// CLOSEST candidate rather than the first one seen. Scheduled-vs-scheduled
/// is the nearest thing this path has to an identity check: two different
/// services out of the same station genuinely do have different booked
/// departure times, however close together they run, whereas their ACTUAL
/// departure times converge as soon as either is delayed.
///
/// A Movement with no `planned_timestamp` at all still falls back to the
/// old, wide actual-time comparison (an unscheduled or ad-hoc working can
/// legitimately lack one, and dropping those outright would lose real
/// resolutions) -- but nearest-first there too, never first-found.
///
/// Ties are broken by `pending`'s own order, i.e. earliest-created wins,
/// which is the caller's documented `tracked_at` sort.
///
/// **Plausibility guard (defense-in-depth against the still-unconfirmed
/// TRUST timestamp corruption -- see
/// `common::trust_timestamp`'s own doc comment for the full background):**
/// before attempting any match at all, `actual_timestamp` is checked
/// against `received_at` (the wall-clock time this process is handling the
/// message that carried it) via `common::trust_timestamp::is_plausible_actual_timestamp`.
/// A message reporting an event that supposedly hasn't happened yet by
/// more than ordinary clock skew is rejected outright -- `None` is
/// returned without consulting `pending` at all, so no pin is bound to

/// `actual_timestamp` even now that the match itself prefers
/// `planned_timestamp`: `actual` is the field the corruption was observed

/// already applied to `actual_timestamp` upstream of this call: even a bug
/// in that correction can't smuggle an implausible value into a matching
/// decision. Callers must NOT resolve the pin on a rejected match -- the
