//! Best-effort resolution of a user's pin (origin CRS + scheduled
//! departure time, date -- no train_uid) against the live TRUST feed. See
//! this plan's Task 10 for why this matches on the first origin-station
//! Movement event rather than on Activation alone (this app has no CIF
//! schedule lookup to bridge Activation's train_uid to a departure time).
//! A heuristic, not a guaranteed join -- same posture the design doc takes
//! on Darwin correlation.
